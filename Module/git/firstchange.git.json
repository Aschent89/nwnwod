            "0": "These ferocious defenders of the Wyld call Greece their home, though they have established a strong presence in North America over the last two centuries.  This tribe, almost entirely composed of female Garou, is renowned for its members' honor, ferocity, and attunement to the sacred.  The Furies claim that Luna, in her aspect as Artemis the Huntress, created their tribe from she-wolves and appointed them to be protectors of the Wyld, defenders of women, and punishers of men.  They uphold these duties with grim determination. \n\nOther tribes look askance at the Furies, who give away or kill their male children.  Many outside the tribe see the Furies as man-haters, but the truth is much more complex.  Although the tribe tolerates male metis, the Furies have a definite gender bias; they believe that women share a deeper bond with Gaia than any man can know, and see themselves as aspects of the Goddess incarnate.  In her name, they Rage against any insult to women, nature or the Goddess.  They accept the Triat and the existence of the Wyrm, but when it encroaches on their territory, woe be unto it. \n\nBlack Furies maintain strong ties to ancient mysticism.  Their rites are complex and quite beautiful, and their Gifts and spirit allies reflect a primal connection to the Wyld.  Prior to any great test, a Black Fury will purify herself in a ritual bath in the open under the light of the moon, typically in a glade protected by the Furies.  This protection is taken very seriously - though the Wyrm must be fought, if the Wyld places are not protected then there will be nothing left after the last battles.  Fury Kin are protected just as righteously, and are often active in their own right working for protection of wilderness and the rights of women. \n\nBlack Furies place a high value on their honor; even their hated rivals concede that the tribe can be trusted.  Although strong in character, they are few in number and their radical stance alienates many Garou.\n\nAttitudes towards other tribes: \n\nBone Gnawers: Harmless street mongrels - but they know more than they let on.  Don't judge them by their smell; they can often be helpful, just like good watchdogs. \n\nChildren of Gaia: Noble and helpful, the only bad thing you can say about them is that they don't do enough.  We are growing tired o their placatory ways, as well...the rage of Gaia will not long be delayed. \n\nFianna: Chauvinistic, self-centered, ill-mannered drunkards, every one of 'em.  A few of them remember Brigid and Rhiannon...but only a few.  Their women are very close to us in spirit.  If their men would only let us fight as comrades we would be a potent force against the Wyrm. \n\nGet of Fenris: Fascist dogs!  They style themselves protectors, and claim that they are the only ones who take action.  For every step we take against the Wyrm, the Get push us two back.  They must be stopped...or euthanized like the rabid dogs they are. \n\nGlass Walkers: They allow the Wyrm to encroach further upon the old places and try to pass it of as some kind of evolution.  They are merely servants of the destructive process which has defiled sacred place after sacred place.  Something must be done about them, and soon. \n\nRed Talons: We are sisters with them, in many ways, for they fight just as desperate a fight.  They would make excellent allies if they could see that our battle is the same as theirs. \n\nShadow Lords: We have seen these manipulative, sweet-talking Lords lie and cheat their way through history.  They have never kept a promise to the Furies, and they are continually selling our people out to the highest bidder.  Do everything you can to expose them for what they are, and when in doubt, fight. \n\nSilent Striders: They are our silent partners.  Help them in any way possible, but watch them - there is something hidden behind their closed jaws. \n\nSilver Fangs: The Fangs still think that the accident of their birth can cause us to respect them and obey their commands.  They are wrong.  We watch these Fangs, and if any of these \"heroes\" interferes with our plans, we will crush them. \n"

            "0": "As hungry mutts, the Bone Gnawers have survived for centuries using their canny ability to sniff out food and sneak about unseen. It's possible that they were originally of jackal stock, although their legends say that they were the \"runt\" of the litter back in the old days: young, tough, and stringy. Today, they are all too used to the role of convenient scapegoats. Few Bone Gnawers have gained enough Renown to play in the greater political field of the Septs and Grand Moots. \n\nThroughout history, Bone Gnawers have followed the dispossessed and the homeless. They hate slavery and oppression in general, but they're often too busy surviving to care about subtleties of Garou politics. They are allied with all the dogs in any given city through a complex system of communication called the \"Barking Chain\". They also know the dark places in the city that are ignored, reviled, or just too dangerous for the uninitiated of the street. Because of this, the Bone Gnawers are well informed about what goes on in the streets of any metropolitan area. This is as much a survival tactic as it is a strategic activity: they need to know when it's time to flee a sinking ship once things go wrong.\n\nThere are some Bone Gnawers who feel that the ship is sinking, and not just Boston, but all of Gaia. These Seekers speak a tale of a newly reborn Gaia deep in the Umbra, far away from the rotting carcass that is this world. It is attitudes like this that encourage most tribes to look down upon the Bone Gnawers as dirty, hungry, and without dedication to the battle with the Wyrm. They would argue that they are simply very practical and thus tend to ignore the more high-minded tribes, even making fun of them from time to time. Ignoring old Garou traditions in favor of practicality often gets the Gnawers in trouble, such as their disregard for the ban on inter-Garou sexual relations. Indeed Metis are received better by the Bone Gnawers than by any other tribe save the Black Spiral Dancers, a comparison not lost on their critics.\n\nWhile the Bone Gnawers are held as the lowest of the low of the Garou, they treat their own Kinfolk more as equals. This can be mystifying to some other tribes, for whom Kinfolk are lessers, usable primarily as breeding stock and for favors in the mortal world. Indeed the familial bonds between a Bone Gnawer and her extended family rival that of the intensely loyal Fianna.\n\nGnawers tend to collect things that they find of interest - trinkets and toys, places and people, and, more importantly, information. They are packrats every sense of the word, as all good followers of Rat should be.  After all, information is an invaluable commodity; they are excellent survivors, and have learned to live in harmony with all the dwellers of the city, including Kindred.  To this day, their relations with the Nosferatu are excellent.\n\nAttitudes to the other tribes: \n\nBlack Furies: Wooo. Okay first off, don't cross them. Second, don't cross them. Third... you get the picture. Oh, and don't make any \"bad phase of the moon\" jokes around them if you like your skin. Best to just stay out of their way, 'cause if one of them is looking for one of us, it's probably bad news. \n\nChildren of Gaia: Gentle people, they want to see the best in anyone and any situation. They haven't spent enough time in the city to see what the world is really like these days. And it's probably best, 'cause they couldn't take it. Generally good folks, and share many of our aims. \n\nFianna: It seems like many Fianna have three emotions: Super-depressed, Super-angry, or Super-Happydrunk. Just watch for which mood their in and you'll be in like Flynn. They're pretty cool and most of them aren't too pretentious to enjoy hanging with us. And they throw a damn fine party, I must say. \n\nGet of Fenris: Vicious stupid bastards. We may talk about the fascist Shadow Lords, but these guys put the Seig in Seig Heil. \n\nGlasswalkers: They figure they're the CEO and we're the night janitor of this old city. They play a bit high and mighty on us in public, but are not too bad in private. Just always remember that they're looking for the bottom line. \n\nRed Talons: Viciouser stupider bastards. We wouldn't mind seeing more Lupus around, sure, but killing all the humans ain't gonna happen, and trying ain't gonna solve anything. \n\nShadow Lords: Don't like em, they don't like us. Don't trust them, they don't trust us. If they ever even give you the time of day, look for the trap. They'd love to bury our whole tribe or send us to a reeducation camp. Don't know which pisses me off more. \n\nSilent Striders: If they ever stay put long enough to get to know them, they'd probably be cool. They're too focused on their missions to have time to harass us for being Gnawers. Just who are they running messages for, really? Did I mention to be real careful if you do the old dance of the street with one? \n\nSilver Fang: They consider themselves the noble lords of the castle, but forget that castles went out of style ages ago. They tell us how low we are, we give them a little bow, and everyone's happy. Since they hate the Shadow Lords, and we hate the Shadow Lords, we're practically buddies. \n\n"

            "0": "When the Wyrm claimed the hearts of the Garou, when the blood of the tribes was shed by the claws of their kin, the Children of Gaia arose to lead the Garou back to the Mother's bounty.  They lifted the Impergium, pressed for peace amongst the tribes and spread the words of Gaia's love among the lands of humans.  To the Children of Gaia, life is a gift to be savored, not a battle to be won.  They are the unifiers of the Garou, the heralds of peace. \n\nThe Children of Gaia insist that embracing violence grants the Wyrm victory by default.  Death is ever a part of life, they concede, but hatred is the gateway to the inner Wyrm, and must be avoided.  Even the Children of Gaia disagree, however, about when the time for talking ends and the time for fighting begins.  When they do choose to fight, the Children of Gaia are powerful warriors, strengthened by their commitment to the Mother.  Until then, these Garou search for a way to resolve conflicts without bloodshed, curing instead of killing. \n\nThe tribe shares a vision of Gaia as a loving, bountiful Mother, and sees the Wyrm as the denial of her love.  The Children rightly predicted that the Impergium would forever drive a wedge between humans and Garou, but the tribe seems at a loss before the coming Apocalypse.  Its leaders still wish to negotiate with the humans and enlighten them before it is too late, but even then the most optimistic Children wonder if the time for peace is past. \n\nThe Children have been given three great secrets by Gaia: \n\nAll creatures who partake of the bounty Gaia freely offers become loving and generous, while those who heed the Wyrm and doubt that Gaia will provide for them become fear-ridden and stingy.  Their fear and greed rule them, and drive them to acts of depravity. \nDepravity is a powerful weapon, for it kills empathy.  The Depraved are cut off from the purest of Gaia's gifts: the connection to all life,and the simple ability to feel the joy and pain of one another.  This depravity drives animals to kill their kin, Garou to slaughter their rivals' children, and Wyrm creatures to try to destroy all life. \nDepravity is a powerful weakness, for only in empathy can joy be found.  Those lacking empathy lack the capacity for joy, and fell its loss deep in their hearts as an unending sadness.  So they pursue idle diversions, seeking to be diverted from the sorrow in their souls.  This weakness is the key to overcoming these foes. \nRather than meet hostility with hostility, the Child of Gaia can transcend his own Rage and visit the Peace of Gaia upon his foes.  By meting hatred with understanding and compassion, the Child of Gaia can replace anger with bliss, hate with joy, and war with peace. Their Gifts heal, protect and nurther rather than harm.  They are deeply attuned to Gaia and all of Her splendor, and prefer to spend time contemplating harmony over havoc. When angered, however, they are terrible in their Rage. \nThe Children are not ignorant of the Wyrm's capacity for destruction - they choose to confront it in their own way.  While other Garou faced with a toxic waste dump spewing out Banes would simply kill the Banes and move on, a Child would likely arrange for a cleanup of the site to deprive the Banes of their source of strength, then track back to the source to work to change the corporation that made the mess in the first place.  The human Kin of the Children are deeply enmeshed in politics, religion and education, working to educate and enlighten humanity in hopes of averting or at least diverting the Apocalypse.\n\nOther Garou grant the Children of Gaia a grudging respect.  Children are known as honorable peacekeepers, if a little soft in the head.  They have proved right in the past, much to their rivals' annoyance, and radiate a deep faith in the Mother's love.  They consider other tribes as follows: \n\nBlack Furies: The fair Furies are worthy allies.  Despite their quick tempers, they come close to understanding the world's desperate need for healing. \n\nBone Gnawers: Our often overlooked brothers have good hearts, and much to offer. \n\nFianna: These singers are warm-hearted companions, and generous with their spirits. \n\nGet of Fenris: Their hair-trigger tempers serve only the Wyrm. We must find a way to reach them before they drag us all down. \n\nGlass Walkers: We have much to learn from these fascinating companions.  Their fearless adaptation to the terror of the cities shows us more about the potential of the Garou than we ever knew. \n\nRed Talons: These much-maligned fighters are daring, spontaneous folk,and as they are not skilled in dissembling, are often refreshingly honest. \n\nShadow Lords: Ambitions, ruthless, and prone to destructive infighting, these warriors must be closely watched.  We should help any faction that promotes inter-tribal unity, because their war against the Silver Fangs could doom us all. \n\nSilent Striders: Good companions, and one of the few tribes who properly understand the peace and power of a quiet walk under the stars. \n\nSilver Fangs: A danger.  Possibly the greatest threat to unity because of their incredible power andebbing sanity.  Our greatest challenge could come not from the Wyrm, not from the Get of Fenris, but from the obstruction to the leaders of all Garou. \n\n"

            "0": "The Fianna claim to be the second Tribe, after the Silver Fangs. It is said that the first Fianna was the first Garou to sing, the first to howl her joy into the air, the first to give in to her passions and breathe beauty into the world. While other Tribes may dispute this claim, they rarely do so to the face of a Fianna. \n\nThe Fianna are a moody lot. While other Tribes have an overall mood, the Fianna seem to embrace all moods. The Get of Fenris rage against their place in the world, and the Bone Gnawers brood over their lot in life, but the Fianna throw themselves into both extremes, often within seconds of each other. Fianna love deeply, and hold grudges beyond their deaths, and suck more marrow out of life than most people can even imagine. \n\nWhile most Fianna come from Ireland or Scotland, others do come from other Celtic groups in Europe. Romania, Spain, anywhere that the Celts roamed is home to the Fianna. But most Fianna look to Ireland as their spiritual homeland. \n\nThe Fianna once shared Ireland with the White Howlers, until that tribe was destroyed by the Wyrm. The White Howlers followed the Wyrm into the bowels of the Earth, fighting it into its lair. No one knows exactly what happened to them down there, but those that came back were foul travesties of Garou. They had become the Black Spiral Dancers, monstrosities serving the Wyrm. These days, Fianna will proudly trace part of their lineages to White Howler families. They will drink a beer and weep bitter tears at their cousins' fates. And they will put aside decade old grudges to join each other in hunting down a Black Spiral Dancer and erasing its hateful visage from the Earth.  Other creatures of the Wyrm suffer the same doom - the Fianna will take the battle to the Wyrm more vigorously than any other tribe. \n\nThe Fianna have a deep connection to the Fey. In the past, Faerie and Fianna intermarried, and many a Fianna can claim direct descent from the Tuatha de Danaan. But these days, the connection is more spiritual than lineal. Few Garou can honestly claim to have met a Faerie, and fewer still have spoken with one. But the Fianna keep their memory alive, out of a sense of respect and obligation, and in the hopes that some day the Fey will return to Earth. \n\nAmong the Garou, the Fianna have the closest ties to their Kinfolk. While most Tribes try to hide their Garou heritage from their relatives, the Fianna are fairly open about it with theirs. This provides the Fianna with a secure foundation from which to battle the Wyrm. Kinfolk ensure that their feckless Garou cousins always have a job available. They comfort them and bring them out of the depths of Harano. And they proudly talk of them after their heroic deaths. \n\nOn the other hand, this close tie with their Kinfolk can also place the Fianna in a precarious position. Looking too closely into the Garou flame can cause Kinfolk to turn to the Wyrm in order to match that flame. Love of their Kinfolk can be used to pressure a Fianna into unwise courses of action. And the loss of a beloved relative can depress a Garou unto suicide.\n\nAttitudes towards other Garou: \n\nBlack Furies: They take pride in themselves and their past. But they don't recognize that women and men are just two sides of the same joyful coin. \n\nBone Gnawers: They do not deserve their infamy. They understand loyalty, and will sacrifice themselves for a packmate without a second thought. They somehow find Gaia's kindness in the wasteland of the Weaver. \n\nChildren of Gaia: A little too harmonious. They don't realize that arguing and fighting make you strong. But they understand love, almost as much as we do. \n\nGet of Fenris: Good drinkers, and some of them can tell a good story. But collectively, they are a sick sado-masochistic macho lot. They can't properly understand what is worth fighting for - they just love fighting for its own sake. \n\nGlass Walkers: They use the Weaver to line their own pockets. They've made the cities their own in a way that is suspicious and disturbing. Capitalists to the end, they'll sell their own mother. \n\nRed Talons: Unlike other Tribes, the Fianna respect their Lupus brothers, which is why we can so keenly feel the Red Talons' pain. But killing all the humans won't bring their dead Kinfolk back. \n\nShadow Lords: A bunch of foolish back-stabbers. They think power is the way to fight the Wyrm, and they'll not only sell their own mothers for power, they'll throw in a sister or two to seal the bargain. Don't trust them. \n\nSilent Striders: Definitely share a drink and a story with these guys, but watch your wallet. They poke into all sorts of things they shouldn't and they ask all sorts of strange questions. Sometimes they'll share some of what they know, and sometimes you'll realize they've swiped the tattoo off your arse. \n\nSilver Fangs: They know their history, they appreciate their families, and they've led us into some mighty fine stories in the past. But maybe their sun is setting, and it's time they got off their thrones. \n\n"

            "0": "The mission set before us by Great Fenris is not easy, nor should it be. We have made our lives into a conquest of any tribe too weak to stop us, and our brutal ways have made us strong. While other tribes ran and hid, we always stood ready to face the enemies of Gaia, and we have watched those enemies fall. We have challenged all of the other tribes, and we have seen the ones that are weak: the Wendigo, the Black Spiral Dancers, the Glass Walkers and Bone Gnawers. They fear us because we are strong. They accuse us of brutality because they are unprepared for the challenges we set before them, because we alone refuse to hide from combat when the time comes for bloodshed.\n\nThe other tribes claim that we are mindless killing machines, but they spend too much time scheming in dark rooms and trying to sneak past the Wyrm instead of simply tearing Jormangundr's putrid heart from his chest! The Warriors of Gaia must never be weak. Even as we long for peace we must call for war. Let the other tribes play their foolish political games, let them thrive like cockroaches in the hearts of the Scabs, growing soft because they no longer understand the need to hunt and to kill. Let them breed with weaker races and raise their young as \"civilized people\". In the end they will understand that we are right, that there can be no peace without sacrifice, that there can be no pleasure without pain.\n\nWe lead them in battle and they will follow us as they always have,, fearing the threats we know are commonplace because they have never sought the Wyrm in its own foul nest.\n\nWe will bring war to them. We will call them forth for Ragnarok and show them the ways of combat. We will watch them run and hide, fearing their worthless hides while we bathe in the blood of the Wyrm and feast on the entrails of Jormangundr's followers. Those few who are worthy will fight with us, and we will accept them as family. Those who die a coward's death shall lay unburied in the fields of battle, reviled and despised as weaklings.\n\nRagnarok is upon us, and the time for friendship is past. Those who would flee from us must be destroyed, for surely they would fall to Jormangundr's wiles. Those that would fight us must be taught the error of their ways, and those who ignore us must be made to remember that we are here, no matter the cost. Those who would be our leaders must prove themselves in honorable combat.\n\nHave no fear of death, for beyond death there is Valhalla. Valhalla, where Fenris waits for us, calling to his Get and sharpening the weapons that will help us in the final conflict. For each of us that falls, Ragnarok comes one moment closer. Do not fear Ragnarok. Instead, prepare for it. Know that Ragnarok is your destiny and the final time when Jormangundr will fall before our might.\n\nThe Fenrir are divided; they fight amongst themselves as well amongst other Garou. Some demand the Impergium be brought back; some have even started enforcing it again. That is the first sign of Ragnarok. The metis population among Garou increases. Perhaps this increase is brought about by too long a time away from Kinfolk and too much time with packs of mixed heritage. This too is a sign of Ragnarok. The Garou must fight greater odds than ever before, and they must fight Pentex, the greatest whore to capitalism that has ever existed. These too are signs. So far the  Fenrir is concerned, Ragnarok is coming.\n\nAttitudes towards other tribes:\n\nBlack Furies: The Furies are a proud tribe, and they have accomplished many feats of which they should be proud. They fight almost as well as men, and they base their lives upon the pursuit of Gaia's happiness. But they are confused. They fight against us when they should submit to us. There is no honor in denying the rights of men to rule over women. Women need the leadership of men to keep them strong in these last days. We have battled the Furies many times in the past, and I suspect we shall continue to struggle against them.\n\nBone Gnawers: There is a rumor that the Gnawers once had Garou stock. These days, they mate with dogs. That does not say much for their heritage, and it says even less for their character. If there were no humans available, would they mate with gorillas? Then again, if they mated with gorillas, perhaps they would have backbones. I Understand they lay claim to several members who once where among the Get of Fenris: I do not believe that nameless outcasts qualify for any other tribe. They may have them. I have never seen a more cowardly lot in my life, and I would sooner see them slaughtered then sit by and watch them mate with the Wyrm. They have no pride, no honor, and no common sense.\n\nChildren of Gaia: They still insist on peace, when the final days are here. I understand what the Children of Gaia are after, but I do not believe all of tribes can be united until they finally realize that we are right, and that, with the Apocalypse so close at hand, few others could even hope to lead the 13 tribes as well as we can. But they cry for peace and insist that we allow the humans to take what they need and do as they please, though it is obviously the humans who need to be culled back the most. If the time for peace is ever going to come, the war must be taken care of first.\n\nFianna: Why can't the Fianna understand that songs are only a small part of our great heritage? They sing, they drink, they fight and they mate. All the while, the Black Spiral Dancers breathe down their necks and we must constantly protect them from the threat of the Wyrm~Garou. Surely we could just let them die, but the Isles are part of our heritage, too, and must be defended. The time for harps is long past. Let them taste the savagery and pleasure of war. Then they shall be worthy to fight alongside us.\n\nGlass Walkers: As best I can figure, the Glass Walkers believe in fighting fire with fire. They believe that by conquering the cities, they can somehow make the cities a part of nature again. This is stupidity. They stare into the Wyrm's mouth and call for bargains and business proposals. The Glass Walkers are only steps away from a merger with Pentex. If that should happen, they will be destroyed. We have our sacred duties to perform, and if those duties require us to kill the Glass Walkers before they can join with the Black Spiral Dancers, then that is what we shall do. There is no excuse for worshipping the Scabs. The only difference between the Glass Walkers and the Gnawers is that the Gnawers are more honest about their self-serving ways.\n\nRed Talons: The Talons are powerful warriors, and worthy of our respect. It saddens me to think that we must eventually sing their funeral dirge, for they are surely the least in number of all the tribes, and the most set in their ways. Still, I believe they could make a difference, if only the Concord were not in their way. Acknowledge that the Talons are our allies, and help them when you can, but know that they are secondary to us. They are too stubborn and foolish to realize that if they would simply join forces with us, we could rule the 13 tribes with ease.\n\nShadow Lords: Do not trust the Lords, for they are back-stabbers and moneylenders. There are many among the Get who claim that the Shadow Lords will offer aid only if there will be a greater profit for themselves in the long run. Be wary of the Lords; always remember that they would sooner see you dead and buried than allow you the right to speak your mind. They would battle the Wyrm with words, while they manipulate others to do their fighting for them. Beneath their pompous airs and manipulative schemes, the Shadow Lords are cowards. The Get of Fenris have no need for cowardly allies.\n\nSilent Striders: The Striders came from the deserts and bear many features in common with the jackal. They are wanderers and vagabonds, and almost as solitary as the ronin. What is it they seek? What is it they run from? I do not feel that they can be trusted. Fight with them, but do not live with them. They come from all races of humans, and they are indiscriminate in their mating habits. How can they be trusted when they have no true heritage?\n\nSilver Fangs: The Silver Fangs were once almost as great as we are, but they no longer recognize the urgency of the war. Do as the Fangs request, for only by watching them carefully can we determine when they are no longer fit to rule the tribes. They have attempted to lead the humans over the centuries, and we can see how poorly they have handled that situation. Watch them carefully, for the Silver Fangs are going mad, and must not be allowed to bring us to our knees. The Garou deserve better. Many of the Get in Europe do not see the Silver Fangs are insane. They want only to believe that the Fangs are their natural leaders. Do not fall into this pit of folly. The Get must be the one who lead the Garou. Let the Fangs play their tricks with the humans and leave the Get to handle the war that must be fought. We shall follow the Silver Fangs, we shall listen to their commands and obey their orders for now. But we will make certain that they do not lead us to the Wyrm.\n"

They are dedicated to reinstating the Impergium, when human population was culled to keep them in check. The Red Talons howl in frustration as they see more and more humans spreading unchecked across the land; as their wolf kinfolk loses more territory to mini-malls and planned suburbia, their Rage grows. \n\nThe Red Talons' views are extreme, even to other garou. Most Red Talons wish to see humans driven to extinction, just as humanity has done to so many other animals. They believe that humans have forfeited their right to existence by gross crimes against nature. While most garou consider them a faction of extremists, their cries are echoed by lupus garou of other tribes. At the same time, most other tribes overlook their strong spiritual nature. No other tribe is as close to the wilderness, and the Red Talons know many secrets of nature forgotten by other tribes. \n\n\"Humans have encompassed far too much of Gaia in the Weaver's embrace. Gaia dies because of it. The lands you call America once was home to 24 subspecies of our gray wolf kinfolk; wolves we shared with the Wendigo and Uktena as breeding stock and packmates. Now there are only five of those subspecies left. Where we once roamed across the entire northern continent, now our packs must hunt only in the colder lands. The balance is broken - in the eastern states, there are more deer now than before the Europeans arrived, and the land is suffering for it. We, the natural predators, have been driven out by the humans. \nHumans have driven countless species to extinction. Why should humanity, who should be one of many of Gaia's children, be special? Why should they be allowed to decide which of Gaia's other children die or survive, according to their whim?\""

            "0": "Wolves are creatures of dominance and submission, mastery and servitude. The Shadow Lords take this quite literally and strive to master all they survey. Shadow lords see the Garou as the ultimate life form on the planet. Therefore, the Garou are the obvious rulers. Furthermore, as far as they're concerned, there is no tribe greater than the Shadow Lords. With that in mind, it doesn't take a genius to figure out the tribe's agenda. In the end, the only thing the Shadow Lords respect from Garou of other tribes is power. Even so, they are always ready to displace their rivals at the slightest sign of weakness. \n\nThough some argue that knowing too well the lures and seductions of the Wyrm beats a quick path to corruption, the Shadow Lords cultivate a unique perspective on the Wyrm that few Garou share. After all, how better to understand its method and madness than to skirt around its edges, learning its scent? Experience not withstanding, the Shadow Lords recognize the enemy's face and understand is intentions better than most Garou - a strength of immeasurable value when resources are slight. Moreover, from their insights stem truly terrifying Shadow Lord Gifts. However, the Shadow Lords must be careful not to drink too deeply of the Urges, lest their dark strengths can become their greatest weaknesses. Their pride and arrogance is easily warped by the Wyrm into full-blown megalomania. \n\nThe Shadow Lords boast a chain of command that would make any corporate division proud. No member is ignorant of his position, power, or more importantly, responsibilities. At the lower end, eager young pups stand ready to fill any vacancy that opens up in the ranks, including vacancies that they sometimes create. Those already in positions of power are constantly on guard against capable upstarts. All in all, the Shadow Lord drive for dominance creates a constant current of change and uncertainty, as those in power inevitably miss a step sooner or later and are brought down. The Shadow Lords' believe in the right to rule through outmaneuvering, outgunning, overpowering, backstabbing and/or assassination - and the right to keep a position in the same ways. \n\nIt is the custom among them to undergo a tribe/pack Rite of Passage beyond that normally instituted by the Sept. Such ordeals are usually designed by the alpha of the pack to put the young Garou in a compromising situation in effort to acquaint him or her with the darker emotions of desperation. \n\nWhen it comes to dealing with the Wyrm, the Shadow Lords use deception and trickery first, only putting themselves in physical harm when it seems that all other options have been expended. This strategy allows them to develop and maintain some indirect relationships with those elements that are close to the vampire and Black Spiral Dancer communities, manipulating them so that they may encourage the Wyrm's resources to destroy itself. They also possess a more intimate knowledge of Wyrm spirits and Banes and are usually best at noticing and tracking their scent. However, when Shadow Lords do resort to direct confrontation, they tend to organize very complete and deadly raids, designed to leave little trace of their involvement (which helps them maintain their contacts for future use)\n\nNo tribe or pack controls their families as strictly as the Shadow Lords. Though their brutal treatment of Kinfolk at times has raised the attentions of other tribal leaders, the Shadow Lords have maintained (albeit it not well received) obedience and submission. Problem elements within the family are quickly subdued most often through physical or social means. It is well known that the Shadow Lords have been trying for many years to produce as many offspring as possible. To this end, as soon as Shadow Lord Kinfolk become fertile, they are arranged to mate with members of the tribe.\n\nAttitudes towards other Garou: \n\nBlack Furies: There is something respectable in their taking control of their lives and making their world as they wish it to be. Their politics, however, can be used against them all too easily. One could argue that their gender bias against men is not practical in this twilight time before the Apocalypse. \n\nBone Gnawers: We have little respect for Garou who cannot stand by their Septmates when things begin to go afoul. Though they are indeed survivors, they tend to appreciate helping humans before helping Garou. It is difficult to reckon on an individual basis whether their concern for others is genuine or a cover for lack of accountability. \n\nChildren of Gaia: Action through inaction. Do not underestimate these Garou, for their agendas are just as ambitious as any you'll find. However, none are so pitiful to see fall to Harano - a Child of Gaia without hope is an irrecoverable soul. \n\nFianna: Their passion and history is rich and none are so close to the Fey. Outside of their own, they are often remarkably open-minded. But they hide their fiery tempers poorly, especially from each other. \n\nGet of Fenris: Of all the tribes, none are so single minded of purpose and adherent to their honor as the Get. But all too frequently, they put their own ideals against those of the Sept. But once set upon a task, they will not stop until it is completed. \n\nGlass Walkers: As foreign to most Garou as the easterns are to the western world, these Garou understand that to overcome one must learn to adapt to the situation at hand. There just might be something in their obsession with the Weaver, too. \n\nRed Talons: Mysterious and alien, these lupus Garou seek not the trappings of human society. They do not speak loudly against Eating The Flesh Of Humans, either. But territory...that is a subject very close to their feral hearts. \n\nSilent Striders: Unreliable and vapid, but occasionally wise when it counts, the Garou of this tribe are never satisfied to establish a domain of their own. It is both a blessing and curse to have no roots - trusted by few but beholding to no one. \n\nSilver Fangs: Arrogance defined. Much like the British royal family, their inbreeding is to blame for the myriad of genetically based quirks they exhibit. However, their efforts to rally Garou into action can carry a persuasive momentum. Those who have earned their nobility, however, are strong Garou, indeed. It is not so much ambition of power they desire - they crave the regard of their fellow Garou most of all. \n\n"

In wolf form they are long and lean, resembling the jackals of Egyptian art, with inscrutable expressions and regal countenanaces.

            "0": "It is said that all Garou were Silver Fangs in the beginning. If one were to take the single best quality from each of the tribes and bring them together in a Garou, that Garou would be a Silver Fang. While many would contest this, none can deny that the Silver Fangs, more so than any other tribe, have been the rallying point, the leaders and court of last resort for the Garou race. The palpable charisma and confidence they exude has made them obvious leaders among Garou. \n\nThese noble Garou are known for their physical beauty, courage, wisdom, and honor. They tend to be very socially apt and a employ a wide variety of skills and gifts. Sadly, in recent generation many members of this tribe suffer from odd quirks - absent-mindedness, mild hallucinations, somnambulism - nothing overtly dangerous in and of itself, but noticeable nonetheless. The noble history of the tribe lays a heavy burden on the shoulders of its members, as many doddering old fools are too proud to ask for help. Still, those who mock the Silver Fang never do so to their faces. \n\nThough the Silver Fangs espouse the superiority of the Garou, they consider meditation, not slaughter, to be their sacred duty. When their ire is raised, however, the Silver Fang shed blood as eagerly as the Get of Fenris. Silver Fangs lead by example. By exemplifying the most noble Garou traits - wisdom, courage, and honor - they inspire those around them to act likewise. The Silver Fang history is replete with heroism. \n\nWhile certainly it is fair to label the Silver Fang as proud and at times snobbish, they view their leadership in Garou society as a service their ancestors have charged them to uphold. Their nobility is as much if not more an honor than a birthright.  Fiercely loyal to each other, the Silver Fang view themselves very much as a venerable household, bearers of centuries of tradition among Garou society. Although learning how to be an effective leader is an expectation, the Silver Fang, when challenged are quick to aid and support one another without hesitation. The occasions when a Silver Fang must choose between loyalty to their tribe versus to their pack can become the source of longtime feuds between Garou. Such rifts, are rarely displayed in public however, since the discord sown often does more harm than good. \n\nThough not nearly so bonded together by familial bonds as with the Fianna, the Kinfolk of the Silver Fang enjoy reasonable relations. Quite often Silver Fang Kinfolk parents will attempt to vie for the good graces of their Garou cousins so that their daughters and sons will be perceived as worthy spouses. This has led to a fair amount of politics among the Kinfolk, at times resembling the political atmosphere of the Elizabethan court. It is a continuing problem for which the Silver Fang have yet to find a desirable solution. \n\nThe Silver Fang often are the first to organize efforts against the Wyrm, trying to make best use of resources and public momentum, often appealing to the Garou sense of immediate action. Even in situations where rushing in is clearly undesirable, the Silver Fangs tend to get the ball rolling as soon as possible. And if their plans needs to be held back a bit, they will be in a better position to put the brakes on if they are the acknowledged leaders of the efforts. The Silver Fangs have no inherent strength against Wyrm spirits, but what they potentially lack in knowledge of the enemy, they make up for by being able to call upon distributed resources of the Silver Fangs' individual packs. \n\nIt is the Rite of Passage among the Silver Fang to welcome those of their tribe as brothers and sisters in a private banquet ceremony held in the new Cliath's honor. At such occasions, one is expected to recount one's lineage (by giving the name and title of their ancestors, complete with heroic anecdotes) as far back as it can be confirmed. First the new members begin, followed by the next highest ranking, and so forth until the Elder of the tribe finishes the evening. It is an old tradition that serves to give their ancestors the respect the Silver Fang feel is due. Though the tradition has critics among the other tribes, the Silver Fang nonetheless find the heroic tales of their ancestors so inspiring that they look to the next Rite of Passage banquet with an infectious anticipation and excitement.\n\nThoughts on the other tribes: \n\nBlack Furies: One of the many splintered viewpoints among the tribes. At least their separatist attitude stops at gender. \n\nBone Gnawers: Of all Garou the Bone Gnawers show the least respect for the noble traditions of our collective ancestry. But amongst themselves, they are very loyal. A paradox, to be sure. \n\nChildren of Gaia: Every leadership needs diplomacy, at which the Children of Gaia seem to excel. \n\nFianna: A fine example of a rich heritage that is well-appreciated. There is more to the Fianna than their families, however. They understand more at times about how the Umbra works than they do about the mundane world. \n\nGet of Fenris: The sword of Gaia. When their honor does not dictate otherwise, these Garou respect the chain of command better than most. When they choose to break ranks, there is little to convince them otherwise. Though they should not be treated as a tool, well-directed, they are among the most effective battle resources. \n\nGlass Walkers:  They are...a different breed among us. Their traditions are based upon entirely different values. One wonders what keeps them fighting for Gaia when the Weaver's temptations seem so prevalent in them. \n\nRed Talons: Difficult to govern, but their motives are well understood. Give them the territory they seek and they will respect yours. \n\nShadow Lords: Shameful and backstabbing, these Garou have lost sight of their honor. Though they have method and usually have Gaia's interests at heart, their dalliance with Wyrm things puts them in a position to be tempted. However, none understand the enemy so well as they. \n\nSilent Strider: No Garou have so little in common with the Silver Fangs as the Silent Striders. Nomads, rootless, and serving no ancestors, they are the paradox among wolves and men. Do not expect their fealty to the Sept. \n\n"

            "0": "The Ragabash\nNew Moon \nQuestioner of the Ways \nOther Names: Daughter (Black Furies), Rotagar (Get of Fenris), The Invisible Moon (Red Talons), Leaf (Stargazers), Trickster (Children of Gaia) \n\nROLE OF THE RAGABASH\n\nBorn in the shadow of an unseen moon, Ragabash, right from the start, are rebels and tricksters among the Garou. Their Auspice is of a moon sign you cannot even see. In a sense, Ragabash have no role in Garou society. Or rather, they have no specific role. It is the duty of a New Moon to defy stereotypes, rebel against rigidly defined roles, to bend the rules and make others see their own rigid way of thinking can spell doom for the Garou. \n\nRagabash bring Wisdom, trickery and insight to the Garou. Ragabash are called the \"questioners of the ways\" because that is what they do. They bring into question what others commonly believe to be true and undeniable, to make others rethink the values they hold dear, to put a spotlight on the laws and ways of society and say \"Just what does this mean?\" But the New Moons do not do this by simply asking questions (not usually, anyway). Instead, they bring values and laws and beliefs into question by defying those things. They teach by an example of what not to do. By embarrassing an Ahroun in front of his pack, he does it to help the Ahroun learn something about his own sense of pride, rather than to simply make mischief. By bending (though never actually breaking) a Litany law, he helps the others to understand why that law is important. As a Ragabash, she can get away with such behavior when any other Auspice would be smacked down for it. A good example of this is the Native American concept of the \"contrary\". Among such peoples as the Oglala Lakota, a contrary was an \"upside down person\", who did foolish things but by doing so brought wisdom to others. They were often thought to be touched by the gods. The Oglala term for a contrary was Heyoka.\n\nTaken from Lakota legend: \"When a person dreams of thunder and lightning, that person is to become a Heyoka, who does everything in reverse which causes people to laugh. Just as the lightning cleanses the earth, a Heyoka brings cleansing to restore balance to those who are depressed, sad, lonely, etc.\" Despite all the rule-bending and rebellious behavior, the Ragabash usually holds those rules and beliefs dear. It is his mission to help the other Garou take another look at those beliefs and gain a deeper understanding and better appreciation of them. The fool brings wisdom through his actions. However, the other Auspices don't always \"get it\", and rarely are thankful for it. New Moons are too often seen as pests and useless jokesters. Other Garou will not heed the words of the jester and even when seriousness is called for many do not heed the words of the New Moons. The Ragabash themselves grow angry as their fellows show them no honor for doing what Gaia expects of them, but they keep at it, for what else can they do? \n\nAs contraries, Ragabash are free of expectations and can do as they wish in many situations. They can do what others do, even if they'll never be as good. They can be great warriors, but not as good as any Ahroun. They can wander the Umbra and traffic with spirits, but will never get along as well as a Theurge. New Moons are able to be \"jacks of all trades\" in a manner of speaking, learning a bit of this and a touch of that. In the end, they can support their packs all the better, for they can back-up the other Auspices and even do things the others may not have bothered to learn. \n\nBorn in the darkness of the invisible moon, Ragabash are the ultimate sneaks and spies. Ragabash can often be found as wilderness scouts, ne'er do wells, thieves and spies. Stealth and subterfuge come naturally to them, and it is a keen Philodox indeed that can catch a Ragabash in a lie. \n\n\nPSYCHOLOGY OF THE RAGABASH\n\nRagabash bend the laws and bring wisdom through foolery. They are little liked for it. The Ragabash must also deal with the Rage that burns in their hearts. Certainly, they have less Rage than the other Auspices, but it is there, and it is a factor in everything they do.  Generally the Garou are not known for the love of humor. Thus, Ragabash always watch their backs. \n\nAngry Jesters? Perhaps. \n\nRagabash are adept at thinking \"outside the box.\" In their position as rule-breakers, they instinctively look for the unthought-of of solution, for the answers others ignore because such answers are either too bizarre or to hard to utilize. But sometimes the best way through is under or over or sideways, not straight forward. New Moons enjoy those sorts of paths. Any idiot can barrel through the door, but subtle can be better, so why not the window or chimney? \n\nCombat may be an Ahroun's forte, but any Garou can fight. Ragabash, as with everything they do, like to find the more novel approach to battle. \"Dirty fighting\" is a term often applied to Ragabash combat styles. Tripping, crotch shots, eye pokes, you name it. Many of the stodgier tribes, like the Silver Fangs and Get of Fenris, frown on such tactics, but when it's the Ragabash, you just can't do anything about it. New Moons are like that. \n\nLying is rarely a problem for New Moons. Denying the truth is just another way to make people rethink just what the truth means. It may not be honorable, but Honor is subject to interpretation. Ragabash have a different view of Honor than Ahroun and Philodox do, which is often a cause of disputes when the Ragabash tries to help those Auspices rethink their concepts of that trait. Ragabash get the most respect among the Bone Gnawers and Silent Striders. The Garou of the cities like the Ragabash approach to life, as trickery and subterfuge are paramount to survival in the human places. The exiled tribe of lone wolves are quite Ragabash in their way, for they are constantly seeking out secrets and exploring the two worlds, and to do so, they must be ready to get past any barrier and obstacle. Such things are rarely conquered by the direct approach. Versatility is important for any wanderer. \n\nROLE-PLAYING TIPS\n\nThe rule to playing a Ragabash is to remember there are no rules. You are there to be the oddball, to be the crazy bastard that somehow makes his wacky plans work. When a puzzle presents itself to the pack, watch what the others suggest, then bring up the possibilities they haven't thought of. When someone starts quoting the rules, counter them with questions. Be the Devil's Advocate. Statistics-wise, anything goes. Many Ragabash tend to have high Wisdom, Charisma and Persuasion. Make those you speak to listen to you and be swayed by the force of your personality. Hide in shadows, move silently, and stealth abilities are often key to what the New Moon does. Beyond that, go crazy. Combat Abilities are always useful, but so is Knowledge of any type. The more a Ragabash knows, the more subjects can she question. \n\nIn the end, Ragabash are hard to pin down because their purpose is to not be pinned down. New Moons do not fit neatly into a pigeonhole, and that is the point. If you are easily defined, then you cannot break molds. \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST  needs to be placed in our acknowledgment file also edited by Galeroth}"

He has powers that go beyond the physical realm, more so than other Garou, and he knows things mortals were not meant to know. The Theurge (pronounced like \"surge\") is an Auspice with deep spiritualism and awesome power. Whether she is the dark and creepy fortune-tellers of the Shadow Lords, the calm pagan priests of the Children of Gaia or the back-alley mystics of the Bone Gnawers, These powers are looked upon with fear and suspicion by the other Garou. For where subduing spirits what happens if you prove weaker and are possessed? The Theurge plays a vital role in the connection between Umbra and Garou. The word 'Theurge' is based on 'theurgy', which is Greek for magical arts. Thus, the name of this Auspice literally means magic. \n\nROLE OF THE THEURGE\n\nNo matter what the tribe or breed, it is the primary duty of a Crescent Moon to parley with the spirit world on behalf of his brethren. Theurges are born with a special connection to the Umbra and its denizens, a connection that gives them a distinct advantage over the other Auspices in all matters spiritual. Thus, it is expected of them to be knowledgeable of the Umbra and skilled in dealing with the spirits. \n\nA Theurge communicates with spirits on behalf of pack and sept, arranging pacts and just generally keeping them happy. Communicating with spirits is perhaps the most vital ability any Theurge will ever learn. Communication is the key to getting on well with Umbrood. After all, if they cannot understand each other, neither Crescent Moon nor spirit will gain anything. \n\nSpirit Lore is something Theurge spend their entire lives learning. No matter how much they learn there is always something new to discover, for there are countless spirits of an endless variety, each more strange and fascinating than the last. It is not just how spirits act, but how they live, how they are born and how they die and how they exist in the exotic environment of the Umbra. Understanding the facets of the Wyld, the Weaver and the Wyrm and how the Triat interacts with each other and the universe is also very important to the battle the Garou face. \n\nCosmology, too, is a Theurge's forte. It is considered a Crescent Moon's duty to be an \"Umbral guide\" for his pack, and every guide needs to know how to get around. When the pack is lost in the far reaches of the Atrocity Realm, it is the Theurge that gets them home. \n\nOn Earth, the duties of the Crescent Moon do not end. In the Caern, she is expected to learn, perform and oversee the many different rites and rituals the Garou possess. Rites call upon the energies of the Umbra, and the Theurge must understand what effects a Rite will have when performed in a certain place at a certain time involving certain Garou. The importance of Umbral 'feng shui' cannot be understated, even if the Theurge is not a Stargazer. \n\nCaerns are centers of spiritual activity, and nobody knows this better than the Theurge. These spirits always seem to know when a Theurge is present, and will take every opportunity to talk to him, starved for interaction with the physical world. A Crescent Moon must make sure the spirits of a caern are cared for and happy. If they are not, it will only mean trouble for the sept. \n\nWhenever a Garou wishes to deal with the spirit world, it is to the Crescent Moons they come. Whether it is to seek information, gain a favor, learn a new Gift or seek a new Garou ability, the Theurge is the medium through which the other Garou communicate. And yet, for all this, the Theurge usually finds herself at odds with her fellow werewolves. \n\nPSYCHOLOGY OF THE THEURGE\n\nThis is perhaps because of the personality of the common Theurge. Most Garou find them.....well......creepy. A Theurge is born with that special intuitive bond to the Umbra, and it has a definite effect on her mind and soul. Crescent Moons are often so distracted. They live in two worlds at once, the physical and the spiritual. When in one, they find it hard to ignore the other. Theurges are all too aware of the Umbrood flying about them at all hours of the day. Thus they tend to be only partially paying attention to what is right in front of them. Garou of other Auspices find this unnerving and annoying. Why can't those damn Theurges focus a little? Try carrying on a conversation with someone who's also probably listening to half a dozen spirits yammer at him as well. \n\nIt is not that the Crescent Moon cannot concentrate on the here and now. They can, easily. It is simply that most of the time, they don't want to. They like being one of those special Garou that are masters of the Umbra. Another reason this Auspice has a hard time getting along with other werewolves is arrogance. Theurges are very knowledgeable, usually very smart. Garou interact with the Umbra a great deal, and the Theurge is called upon a lot to help. This breeds a certain amount of superiority in the personality of a Theurge. He knows his pack can't get along in the Umbra without him. He knows the Ahroun needs him when that big thug wants to learn that Combat Gift. There is a reason that social interactions with beings in the physical realm falls to the Galliard, Philodox or Ragabash. The Theurge will usually piss everybody off, just like the Ahroun will scare everybody away. \n\nTheurges can be nice, certainly. As nice as any Garou is capable of being. It's not easy to be a sweetheart when you have Rage. But that hubris colors every Theurge's personality just a tiny bit. At best a Theurge is somewhat tricky to get along with. At worst they are outright assholes. Breed and tribe also colors a Theurge. \n\nHomids tend to be more analytical with the spirit world, apply scientific thought processes even when they don't know anything about science. Humans just tend to think that way. Metis and Lupus are more intuitive. Metis grow up in Caerns, surrounded by active spirits, and often see spirits as childhood friends (ones that never judge her for her deformities like the Garou do). Lupus interact with spirits like they interact with everything else. It is a predator and prey outlook, and relationships with spirits are generally based on dominance, as in a wolf pack. \n\nIn the tribes, outlooks on how to deal with spirits vary. The Children of Gaia, Black Furies, Silent Striders, and Stargazers take a supplicant approach, being as respectful and harmonious with the Umbrood as they can, giving up sacrifices and gifts of whatever the spirits desire. Meanwhile, the Silver Fangs, Red Talons, Get of Fenris, and Shadow Lords (especially the Shadow Lords) will take a more dominant stance, going on the offensive in spirit negotiations and getting the respect of Umbrood by force, if necessary. More practical tribes such as the Bone Gnawers and Fianna will usually try to 'buddy up' to Umbrood, offering bribes of what is dear to that specific spirit for favors. All of these approaches work, though typically with different sorts of spirits. There is a reason Grandfather Thunder's Brood are spirits of dominance and edginess. It is because they respond well to the fierce approach of the Shadow Lord Theurges, just as Rat's Brood responds well to the sly techniques of the Bone Gnawer Theurges. But Crescent Moons are not stupid, and they know well enough to change tactics if they must deal with a spirit who requires a different approach then the Theurge typically uses. \n\nROLE-PLAYING TIPS\n\nBeing as cerebral as they are, Intelligence and Wisdom tend to take precedence among the Theurges. It takes a sharp mind, quick wits and a watchful demeanor to deal with the spirit world. Physical attributes would come secondary in many cases. The Crescent Moons are no pushovers in fights, and dealing with spirits is often physically demanding. Remember in battle, it is the Theurge who will call down the wrath of Luna down upon their most hated foes, those touched by the Wyrms corruption.  Charisma usually comes last. Theurges are rarely very sociable or good-looking, though they do tend to know how to get what they want out of others. \n\nTheurges seek out and devour knowledge. Books and scrolls of all types - They WILL come to you, no matter who finds them. You expect them and if they are not given you will demand them. Theurges are great puzzle-solvers. Healing has its place as well. Many a Theurge has several levels in several Crafts. Being able to create a finely made Fetish will only please the spirit and help to ensure the success of binding the spirit into it. Persuasion has its place, for a Theurge must often be highly respectful to powerful spirits and \"help\" it see the need for the Theurges request. Music can help to placate many a spirit, so it is not unheard of for a Crescent Moon to possess Performance. \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST needs to be placed on acknowledgement page.

It is they who settle disagreements, decide guilt and innocence, meet out punishments. While the Theurge knows the wisdom of spirits, and the Ragabash knows the wisdom of the fool, the Philodox knows the wisdom of the law. \n\nIt is the duty of a Half-Moon to uphold the laws of Garou society. They know the Litany inside and out and can recite it by heart. While some Garou may question or even shirk certain Litany laws, the Philodox understand why such laws exist and why they have been kept to this day. It is the Half-Moon's job to remember the Litany at all times and remind others when a law may about to be broken. A Philodox's pack mates regularly look to him for advice on how to act in accordance with the Litany, and he is always glad to give it. \n\nPhilodox are expected to be impartial when mediating, especially if someone in the dispute is a pack mate. A Philodox can have no biases. She must be fair and objective or her words mean nothing. A Half-Moon's honor is in her word. If she show favoritism in her judgments and it becomes known, her honor is destroyed and no one will trust her judgments for a long time to come. There is a reason most pack alphas are Philodox, for they show they have the wisdom to lead (except in times of war, when the Ahroun usually take over). Honor is the most important aspect of Garou life to Philodox. Not just their own honor, but that of every other Garou around her. It is her duty to help the other werewolves to maintain their honor, both by example and advice. A Philodox is often the exemplar of the honorable Garou. This is why the other Auspices know they can trust her word and judgment, for they know she always acts with honor. Her word is law. \n\nThat is the ideal. However, in these days of Christendom, disillusionment affects many a Half-Moon, making them wonder \"what's the point?\" Corruption can also find its way into a Philodox's heart, leading her to make judgments that lead to her own personal gain. When those who work to maintain everyone's honor have lost theirs, what is to be done? Who watches the watchers? The Philodox are not the infallible mediators they once were, but the other Garou know that. So while the Philodox's word is usually listened to, it is always with a grain of salt. \n\nAmong the tribes, Philodox gain the most importance among the Children of Gaia, Shadow Lords, Silver Fangs and Stargazers. The Children and the Stargazers both seek the peace and balance of the Half-Moon, while the Lords and Fangs tend to see the honor and power the Philodox has in the Garou Nation as highly favorable. The Warders of Men also place greater importance on the Half-Moon, for a Garou in balance can get along more easily among humans. A keen judge will weigh all sides fairly in dealing with humans.\n\nPSYCHOLOGY OF THE PHILODOX The Auspice of the Half-Moon neatly represents the nature of the Philodox. They are creatures of duality, more so than other Garou. Man and wolf, flesh and spirit, rage and honor. Everything is in balance for the Philodox. Their Rage is usually in the middle ground, compared to other Auspices. And they work hard to maintain their sense of balance. A Philodox who is emotionally or spiritually out of balance is not of any use to anyone. \n\nA Half-Moon wants to help others maintain honor. They have an instinctive urge to settle arguments, to keep their pack mates in as much balance as possible. They are the \"den mothers\" of their packs, making sure all runs smoothly. When a pack mate has a problem, it is the Philodox who responds to that need first. \n\nIt is a tough road the lawgiver walks, a tightrope he must constantly make his way over. Keeping one's honor in theses day is difficult at best, and even harder when your honor is your livelihood. A Philodox wants to be trustworthy (or at least perceived as such). She knows no one will come to her with their problems if they cannot trust her. A dishonorable Philodox is a lonely Philodox. \n\nIt is well known that the Philodox wants to experience all aspects of Garou life, Running and Hunting as the wolf, learning the ways of Man, traveling across both the land and the spirit world \nROLE-PLAYING TIPS\nRemember, to be impartial and fair to everyone. Your character's personal feelings towards a certain Garou should be irrelevant when his duty is at hand. Be fair to all. Do nothing that allows someone to accuse you of showing favor to one side or the other (or at least do nothing obvious, if you insist on being corrupt). \n\nKnow the Litany. Read it over, study it, and understand it. Learn the point behind each law, and how each law is generally upheld. Learn your tribe's views on the laws. It will give you a handle on how your tribe expects you to uphold the Litany. This also goes for the sept's laws and decrees. A Philodox should be aware of all such regulations the sept elders lay down, and be prepared to see that they are being followed. The sept leaders expect you to do so. Stat wise, they need to be Wise and knowledgeable and Observant to do their duty accurately. High charisma and persuasion will aid you when you need your word heard and obeyed more easily. \n\nAs a general rule of thumb, you need to be conversant with laws both Human and Garou. Learn all you can of the Litany and be able to recite when you need to remind Garou of their laws.  Learn what you can of the rituals. For as judges, Philodox must be familiar with the Rites of Punishment and Accord.\n\nIn the game, a Philodox almost always has her Rage under control. This means unlike the other Garou, you are not ready to \"go off\" on someone at the drop of a hat.  You must remain in control; keep those frenzies at bay if you can! This does not mean you cannot be angry or frenzy, it just means you will always (ALWAYS) seek out other alternatives to solve your problems before you rip out someone's throat.\n\n There is no one Breed that makes a superior Philodox. All Breeds can have the wisdom necessary to make solid judgments, and all understand the importance of the law. Admittedly, Lupus may have trouble with more human concepts, and Homids may allow politics and favoritism to creep in, and the Metis have a hard time getting respect no matter what their Auspice is, but none is better than another for the role of a Half-Moon. \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST and Galeroth please place on acknowledgements page.}"

Filled with intense passion and a love of what has come before, the Moon Dancers keep the history of the Garou alive. History is incredibly important to the werewolves. Their deeds and victories and defeats make them who they are today, just like with any culture. But Garou are far more aware of this than humans. History stays with the Garou very strongly. The spirits of their ancestors come to them with the wisdom of the past very often, and the Silver Record is a storybook like no other. A Garou's soul is reincarnated many times down through the centuries. The Garou have always worked hard to keep the ties to their past strong. \n\nThis is where the Galliard comes in. It is the duty of the Moon Dancer to keep history alive. It is they who sing the tales, both good and bad, to bring their fellows wisdom through citing example. Garou do not generally keep written records. Living in secret as they must, they try to leave as little in the way of physical evidence of their existence as possible. Only the Silver Record is the exception. \n\nBut there are so many more stories and songs, important tales not to be forgotten, that didn't make it into the august listings of the Silver record. The Garou must rely on an oral tradition to keep this lore alive, and it is the sacred duty of the Galliard to do this. \n\nWhen a grand battle has been fought, it is the Galliard's duty to make sure it is never forgotten. By singing the songs of great past deeds, the Galliard can instill courage and confidence in his pack, urging them on to victory in their current struggles. \n\nDetailing the current deeds of the Garou is important as well. A pack's Galliard must sing his pack's song at the Moots, relate their deeds, so that the Garou as a whole will recognize their achievements and he and his pack mates will gain honor. Without the Galliard to tell of these deeds, the legends of the Garou of today will never grow. \n\nOnly the Galliard is trusted to sing these songs of Renown. It is a serious duty, one that every Galliard performs honestly. Moon Dancers would not lie of false deeds to further his own or anyone else's reputation. Doing so damages the honor of the Galliards greatly. Those that ever have are always caught in their lies, either by Philodox or by the spirits. The Gibbous Moons take great pride in being truthful (within reason of artistic license) in their duties. \n\nPSYCHOLOGY OF THE GALLIARD \nGalliards are most famous for their passion. It's not just Rage, it is joy and intensity and creativity. It's lust for life and love of history. Galliards are not known for their self-control. Restraint is not in their vocabulary. New experiences excite them, and they often go seeking out such. Every new experience is a new adventure, and new adventures make for new stories and songs. \n\nMoon Dancers feel deeply. They are often empathic and sensitive to others feelings because of this. This gives them an edge in dealing with others. Sensing someone's motives or being able to guess how someone might react makes Galliards expert negotiators. \n\nMusic is the way the world sounds. It is the rhythm of life, and Moon Dancers feel that music best of all. From the ancient howls of wolves to primitive tribal drums to each new type of music they come in contact with, Galliards make for natural musicians. The beat attracts them, even if the particular type of music repels them. Red Talon Galliards obviously despise any human music, but occasionally find it intriguing nonetheless. \n\nA love of history. What does it stem from? Who knows? The Gibbous Moons find themselves drawn to ancient chronicles and tales of unheard glory. Maybe it's the allure of being the first to discover a new story, or perhaps it's the urge to relate it all to others, to be 'the one' that delivers the tales. Or it could be just a curiosity of what has come before. The pull of Luna can be just as strong as a simple desire to learn. \n\nGarou history is very alive. It is not something learned through reading dusty old books. It is learned through song and story and adventure. Thus, it holds a greater allure to the Garou whose duty it is to safeguard it. \n\nROLE-PLAYING TIPS\nGalliards are always interested in history and current events (which will become tomorrow's history). As the custodians of werewolf tradition, it is something that is in their blood. The Galliard is an excellent choice for players who enjoy storytelling and keeping journals of in-character events. It can be a creative outlet for a player with aspirations of being a writer (or even someone who just enjoys writing as a hobby). Musical talent is also a plus, and a player that can compose an original song of his pack's deeds is really going the extra mile. \n\n Galliard characters should focus on charisma. Galliards are known for their magnetic personalities and persuasive talents. Strength can be important, for Galliards, with all their passion, often express it physically. Intelligence will help a Galliard remember every detail of an adventure. \n\nObviously, performance and persuasion are important skills. Any Moon Dancer without at least a single level in them is going to be very bad at her Luna-given duties. Crafts also finds a place among a Galliard's range of skills, for the auspices artistic bent can give way to painting, woodworking and other ways to showcase their talents. \n\nA good number of Galliards know how to behave and interact in various social circles. Indeed, a Galliard is often the pack's \"face man\" (or woman). Their high charisma gives them an advantage in dealing with others.  They should remember things that have happened ACCURATELY.\n\nFinally, Galliards are expected to perform many Rites, such as the Moot Rite, Gathering for the Departed and others. Thus, you should research out information on Rituals. They may come into play later. \n\n Galliards are about passion, not self-control. Often, their Rage and anger are high - just below the surface. This is not to say they go around with a chip on their shoulders. It means the experience all emotions deeply. So, if your character is in a bad mood, play it up and hope everyone stays out of your way. Your emotions show through in \"how\" you play. However, this comes with the obvious social penalties, for humans are uncomfortable with the Beast Within. Thus, many Galliards (Homids, at least), learn to maintain control of the Beast. Lupus and Metis Galliards typically don't care what humans think of their personalities. Don't hold back when playing a Moon Dancer. Cut loose. Feel every emotion deeply.  \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST and Galeroth - please place on acknowledgements page}"

            "0": "The Ahroun\nFull Moon\nProtector of the Ways\nSpirit Warrior\nOther Names: Warrior (Black Furies), Modi (Get of Fenris), The Seeing Moon (Red Talons), Fist (Stargazers), Defender of Luna (Children of Gaia)\n\nThe word Ahroun (aw-ROON) was created by the Fianna, and most tribes use the word as well, though some insist on their own names. The Ahroun are those Garou born during the full moon, and are thus blessed with the destiny of the soldier.  The full moon shines with all of Luna's might. All her passion, anger at the defilers and lust for battle is poured down upon the Earth.  The Garou being born under the full moon, are gifted with these strengths and weaknesses in excess. Thus are the Ahroun.\n\nROLE OF THE AHROUN\nAll Garou are \"Gaia's Warriors.\" She made them to fight and die to protect her from the excesses of the Wyrm and Weaver. But even among a race of warriors, there are those who are the true fighters. The best of the best. The cream of the crop. These are the Ahroun. To the Red Talons, he is the pack defender and skilled hunter. To the Bone Gnawers, he is the Brawler defending children on the streets. To the Silver Fangs, a knight. It is the place of the Ahroun to fight. They are expected to be skilled warriors, and an Ahroun who doesn't know how to throw a punch worth a damn is letting his tribe down. An Ahroun who can't fight is useless. Fortunately, such Full Moons are rare. Almost all want to be skilled warriors. \n\nBeing born under the full moon gives them the urge to hone their combat skills. Hand-to-hand combat, melee or long distant weapons, you name it. The Ahroun is the hunter of prey, the slayer of monsters, and the defender of the weak. More than any other auspice, the Ahroun epitomizes the Garou. He is the symbol of the Garou struggle, the icon of their war. He is all that is violent, unstoppable and valiant in the Garou nation. The Ahroun is also all that is foolish, impetuous, vicious and destructive among the Fera.\nThus, the Ahroun epitomizes the Garou struggle between their dual natures: the noble hero and the bloodthirsty wolf. \n\nYoung Ahroun's are the hot-headed warriors, always seeking the next foe to best, always wanting to prove their mettle. They are the ones who stand upon their enemy's corpse and howl for the next foe to come. Elder Ahroun's are the grizzled old soldiers who have fought everything and lived to tell about it. Experience has tempered their impatience, and although the Rage still burns hot, they have learned to control it better. These old warriors are the deadliest combatants in the world. They make wise leaders. The rage is still there but, they have mastered it enough to put it to other uses.\n\nAhroun gain the most respect among the Get of Fenris, Red Talons and Silver Fangs. These tribes value battle and the virtue it brings. Indeed, it is required that the kings of the Silver Fangs be Ahroun. Glory, perhaps unsurprisingly, is the type of Renown of most value to Full Moons. Their purpose is combat, and the glory of combat thus brings them power and respect. The Protectors of the Ways have their code of honor, however. They are not the mindless killers other Auspices make them out to be. The Ahroun does not want to slay without thought. She wants to be the honorable warrior. Like the samurai of ancient Japan, Ahroun live and die by the sword, and how they live their lives is as important as how they die. Thus, Honor is a prized Renown as well. Wisdom has its place as well, for the Full Moon that is wise becomes the craftiest of fighters. \n\nPSYCHOLOGY OF THE AHROUN\nEven among the normally serene Children of Gaia and Stargazers, Ahroun are known for short tempers. Being born under the full moon, they have more Rage in their hearts than any other Garou. It sizzles just beneath the surface of their personalities. At best, the Ahroun is a stern, terse person. At worst she is a psychotic killer. It is a life-long struggle for the Garou to keep their tempers in check, for frenzies are always just a moment's annoyance away. Life is often short for an Ahroun. Battle calls constantly and a blaze of glory is almost always how an Ahroun's career (and life) ends. Few Full Moons die of old age. Life is hard, violent and short for these werewolves. And they know it. And it's just fine with them. \n\nWhile some Garou may shun violence or get a bit sickened by sprays of blood and gore, this is never true of the Ahroun. They live for this. Nerves of steel and cast-iron stomachs come with the job. It is rare for an Ahroun to be polite and well-mannered. Most just don't have the patience for it. They tend to be gruff and often bawdy. They're going to die tomorrow, so why not enjoy today? A good meal, a dirty joke, a roll in the hay with that pretty Kinfolk, it's all good. Get your jollies out now, because the next battle may be your last. Still, other Garou know well enough not to piss an Ahroun off. No one wants to risk a frenzy of those proportions. One can be friendly with an Ahroun, but taunting one is foolhardy. Ahroun are death on wheels, and nobody wants one for an enemy. There is no fear of death for a Full Moon. It simply isn't in them. If you are to die, then so be it. An Ahroun only hopes to take as many of the enemy with him as he can. A glorious death is the best death. So make it one for the Silver Record. \n\nROLE-PLAYING TIPS\nThe Ahroun has long been considered the refuge of the twink. He has to do nothing but fight, after all, and power gamers live for that. Not so. When you play an Ahroun, remember the emotions, the rage and the warrior's code. When played right, a Full Moon has just as much potential to the role-player as any other Auspice. The emotions should always be remembered. Rage is strongest in the Ahroun, and it should show. 'Nice' Ahroun are few and far in between. Show that inner anger, play it as burning just beneath the surface, demonstrate how your Ahroun struggles to keep it down until he needs it. \n\nAs a \"Protector of the Ways\", it is the Ahroun's place to defend his people. When danger comes, never hesitate to step up to the plate and face it. The other Garou are not as tough as you, and if they are to perform their duties, you must protect them. If you die in the doing, fine. That's your job, and it's an honorable one. Think of an Ahroun as a cross between a samurai and a Viking. She follows a warrior's code, but at the same time, she is boisterous and wild. Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you may die. And then, you hope to die with glory and honor. \n\nWhatever you do, do not go around picking fights with other Garou to prove how tough you are. For one thing, that method leads to other players disliking you and your character, and in the end nobody will care how tough you are. They'll just want you gone. Ahroun are not subtle people. They are straightforward and honest (some would say blunt). Lying is seen as cowardly and dishonorable, and the Ahroun should be neither. Leave that for the Ragabash. \n\nSubterfuge is not a common ability among Full Moons. Rage is an Ahroun's best friend and his worst enemy.  High combat stats should be par for the course. It is in a Full Moon's best interests to have such abilities. Any weapon skills (ANYTHING that can be used as a weapon - pick up the skill if you can) are very vital to the Ahroun. The Ahroun is a combat oriented Auspice - play it so. This is not to say the Ahroun ignores knowledge, the knowledge is however, combat oriented - Vampire Lore to learn how to kill Leeches better, Wyrm Lore to identify Banes, etc. Never turn your back on a book or scroll that may well give you an advantage in battle. The Ahroun's who die young, some of them did not avail themselves of knowledge and their stupidity brought about their own deaths and others.. \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST **needs to be placed on acknowledgement page.

            "0": "SOCIOLOGY OF THE PACK \n\nThe pack, it is the most fundamental unit of Garou society. Humans and wolves are both social animals, grouping together by desire and instinct. Garou, being of both human and wolf, and given their intense emotions, are even more socially inclined. \n\nWhat this means is that Garou, all Garou, WANT to be in packs. It's their nature. It's an instinctive urge, a pull at their very souls that drives them to find and join a pack. A Garou without a pack just.... doesn't feel right. She feels naked and alone and vulnerable. She suffers from sadness and a loneliness that only other Garou can sympathize with. She feels incomplete and weak until she is one with a pack. \n\nA pack is basically a second family. Remember that most werewolves, after their First Change, are torn away from their original families or wolf packs, likely to never see them again. A pack gives them back that sense of family. A pack is your friends, your family, and it is your fighting unit. The totem binds the pack together on a spiritual level as well, providing a connection to one another that Garou cannot find anywhere else. A pack is a unique form of family that can be found nowhere else. They are brothers and sisters in arms, bound by spirit. \n\nIf your Garou character is not in a pack, I can only ask: Why not? Is your character ill? Is she not feeling well? Is she insane? Trust me; your werewolf wants to be in a pack. She can feel it in her heart. It's a yearning she cannot ignore. It's a pain that rends their hearts everyday they are without a pack! This is why being declared Ronin is such a horrid punishment to the Garou, for it becomes impossible for the Ronin to ever again join a pack. \n\n\"But my character doesn't feel that way.\" you say. Bullshit, I say. In that case, your character has to be nuts or stupid, or both. There's no excuse for a Garou not wanting to be in a pack. Any werewolf that says as much is going to be thought of as a whacko by the others. A Garou that doesn't want a pack just isn't right in the head. \n\n\"But what of the Silent Striders?\" you ask. They are cursed. They are forced to forever wander the world, living alone without pack or mate. The urge is still there, though. Striders still want to be in packs. That's why their curse is called a curse, after all. They suffer in silence. \n\n. \nOf course, making a pack comes at a price. You will be expected to carry out missions for the sept. That's what packs are for, after all - to perform missions and serve the sept. The sept needs packs, now more than ever, for the Wyrm grows strong.\n\nLOSING A PACK-MEMBER \n\nIt's the most heartbreaking experience a Garou can have. To lose a member of your pack is to lose a part of yourself. A part of your own soul dies when a pack-brother or sister leaves. \n\nTo lose your entire pack, leaving only yourself alive, is tragic in the extreme. That is the start of Harano and suicide watches. A Garou can never recover from losing his whole pack. It will haunt him always. \n\nEJECTING A PACK-MEMBER \n\nIt is no light decision to force a member to leave the pack. Such an individual must have made major transgressions against the pack: greatly disgraceful actions, putting the pack in constant danger, continually fighting with fellow pack-members, breaking numerous Litany laws... An unruly member who doesn't even try to change his ways will quickly find himself alone. Pack brethren can be forgiving of their own, but they have their limits. \n\nNeedless to say, a Garou who betrays his pack to the Wyrm will quickly find himself dead by his pack's claws. That is something that will break the pack's trust instantly. \n\nA Garou who breaks the Litany or does other dishonorable things brings shame to his whole pack.  All Sept's will hold the entire pack responsible for the actions of a criminal member. If a pack member breaks the Litany or loses a significant amount of honor for disgraceful actions, his packmates will lose honor also. They become \"guilty by association\"; for they are supposed to have made sure their member would not commit such crimes. Packs are responsible for the actions of their members. This is another reason unrepentant criminal members are often expelled. \n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nPacks are the fangs and claws of Gaia. Wolves were selected as Gaia's protectors for numerous reasons. The most important is the pack mentality. A pack of normal wolves can chase down and kill prey easily five times stronger than any single wolf. As Garou are warriors, fighting against impossible odds, the essence of the pack remains as their most powerful advantage.\n\nHaving pack mates to rely upon provides fellowship, something the Curse makes hard to come by. A Pack is often the only family a Garou can acknowledge. A Pack provides friendship, emotional support, and an assault force all in one. When werewolves stand united, in a pack, towards a single purpose... it can be a terrifying and beautiful thing to behold, as elegant a brutality as can ever be found in all of nature. \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST  needs to be placed on acknowledgement page and edited by Galeroth}"

            "0": "What is Rage? It's not that simple a question. Unfortunately, many players tend not to think of it much beyond the thought of a possible frenzy when fighting. If asked, they may say something like \"It's what lets me go berserk.  Rage is a vital component of Werewolf: Dark Ages, and more than any other Trait, it defines what the Garou are. \n\nRage is that inner anger every Garou (and most other Changing Breeds) possess. It is a touch of the fury that Gaia feels at the destruction of the natural world, a fury she has shared with her children to motivate them in their war. It is a boiling cauldron of passion that lurks in every Garou's heart, and no matter how small it might be, it is there, and it is something the werewolf cannot ignore. \n\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE? \nHave you ever been really angry? Now, I mean really, utterly pissed off? So mad you believed you could kill someone? That all you could think about was hurting who or whatever angered you? \n\nOkay, now take that and multiply it by 10, and then you'll come close to what your average Garou feels everyday. Rage is not something that can be ignored until you need it. It is always there, seething just under your other emotions. Ready to explode at a moment's notice. \n\nIt is much like a caged beast, the Beast Within, if you will. And the lock on that cage is pretty flimsy. It won't take much for that beast to bust out and wreck havoc. Rage is a ticking time bomb. It can and will blow up with little provocation. Frenzy can happen at any time in battle, when the lust for mayhem and the anger at your enemies grows too great.\n\nIt's like being a borderline psychopath, always having this maddening killing urge lurking just beneath the surface. Your vision runs red too easily. In short, Garou are not happy beings. Sure, they can experience joy and laughter like any other living being. They have a full range of emotions, but everything is tainted by their Rage. It's always there, and they always know it. \n\nLUNA'S BLESSING \nRage comes from Luna, the Celestine of the Moon, so the Garou legends say. She gifted the werewolves with this power in the beginning so that they may fight fiercely and never surrender. Fact supports this. The moon has a very acute affect on Rage. \n\nFirst, there is the affect the moon phase has on a Garou's attitude. The fuller the moon, the angrier the werewolf gets. When Luna shines her full face upon the world, the Garou are at their edgiest, ready to fly into frenzy at the drop of a hat. \n\nJust seeing Luna for the first time every night can cause a werewolf's rage to flood through there bodies. Their hearts tympani with the swelling of rage Luna brings. They say that it is Luna's way of reminding the werewolves, subconsciously, of what they fight for. \n\nTHE PRICE OF POWER \nBut of course, there is a price to pay. That cost is the ever growing chance that the Beast will get out of control. When the Beast has awakened too much, Frenzy occurs. Frenzies are when the Garou completely loses control of the Wolf in her heart and becomes nothing more than a berserk monster. Frenzies can only be halted by time. \n\nGarou do not approve of frenzies. It reminds them that they are not the noble heroes many of them like to see themselves as, and are instead bloodthirsty animals. It is a truth few of them enjoy contemplating. Friend, foe, innocent bystander....none of it matters to a frenzying werewolf. All are targets. All are enemies. Too often a Garou has come out of a frenzy to find she has slaughtered her own family. \n\nFrenzies become easier as Luna shows more of her face to the world. The time of the full moon is quite rightly feared by many humans. This is the time the Garou are at their edgiest, and their anger is ready to boil over at the drop of a hat. It has also been a noted fact that frenzies happen more often when a shape shifter is in Crinos form. It is a body designed for battle, and the Rage flows more easily in this form.  \n \n\nRECOVERING \nFrenzies last for as long as the werewolf senses danger. If the danger has passed, or if he has escaped from it, the Garou will come out of the frenzy after he has managed to calm down and catch his breath \n \n\nTHE WYRM AND RAGE \nThe Wyrm poisoned the Rage that Luna gifted to the Garou, the legends say. The Wyrm found out about Gaia and Luna's plan to craft her defenders, and the Wyrm secretly sabotaged the project by making sure their Rage would never be something the werewolves could control, by making it something that could drive them to acts they would despise themselves for. \n\nIn other words, like many other things, the Garou blame frenzies on the Wyrm. Yet there is some proof the back-up this knee-jerk reactionary claim. For sometimes, frenzy can get so out of hand that the werewolf becomes a monster that commits terrible depravities. This event is known as the Thrall of the Wyrm. \n\nThese abnormal frenzies are rare, but when they happen the sickening results cannot be denied. These are not just frenzies. They are acts of depravity and perversion, brought on by the Wyrm's influence of the werewolf's heart. \n\nStrangely, the Garou's breed has an effect on just what happens. It is said the Triatic Wyrms, the three faces of the Wyrm itself, enjoy prodding select breeds into particular perversions. \n\nHomids become cannibals, eating human, wolf and werewolf flesh with an unequaled gluttony. The Eater-of-Souls perverts the Homids, driving them to unholy consumptions. Lupus are taken over by the Beast-of-War, removing all traces of mercy, driving them to attack the weak and helpless, destroying even fellow pack mates if they are badly wounded. And the Defiler Wyrm, in perhaps the sickest event of all, pushes the Metis into disgusting acts of sexual obsession, even necrophilia. \n\nTHE CURSE \nThat weird guy in the corner that could be a serial killer with the way he looks at everyone. The girl next door that seems to be permanently PMSing. When a Garou feels angry, humans knows it. It makes them uneasy around the Garou, as they can sense the Beast. The instinctual reaction that inflicts the Delirium in humanity, the subconscious memory of the Impergium and the nights of terror it created, allows humans to notice that excessive Rage. \n\nGarou call it the Curse. It is why they must often live apart from humanity. Their Rage rarely allows them to fit in. Friendships and marriages to humans become hard as hell to maintain, the Rage always becoming a factor in the relationship. And when frenzies happen, as they always will, it can be nearly impossible for the humans in the Garou's life to forget or forgive the bloody horrors that usually result. Even with Kinfolk it is rarely easy. \n\nEven among wolves, it is never easy. Animals get uneasy around Garou with the Curse. Wolf packs shy away. It is only among each other that Garou find any peace, but even then their own laws forbid such relationships, for fear of the genetic dead-ends it produces. \n\nRage is a tool, it is a weapon, and it is a blessing. It is also a double-bladed sword, cutting the Garou as well as his enemies. It is a curse and a burden... one that cannot be gotten rid of. \n\nUse it well, and be careful. \n\nROLE-PLAYING RAGE \nIt doesn't happen often enough. Players tend to conveniently forget how Rage factors into their character's personality. Garou are not happy beings. They are very rarely in control of their emotions. They are passionate in the extreme. Players too often portray Garou as humans who can change shape and get extra actions in combat. \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST  needs to be placed on acknowledgement page and edited by Galeroth}"

            "0": "The Resolve of the Garou\nSimply put, the Garou are out to save the world, fighting the forces of corruption and stasis to save what remains of nature in a dark world. Though some could call this goal one of arrogance and hubris, the immense pride of the Garou comes from many sources. Of all the shape-changers, only the Garou run in packs and no others work as well together, though strife tears at this. Even before the Impergium, the Garou were more numerous and more widely traveled, living in Gaia's splendor in almost every location across the globe. Finally, each Garou is one of Gaia's Chosen, the final defense from the predations of the Wyrm. \n\nThough the goal is known, the means are the single most continuing point of debate. The line between friend and enemy is sometimes clear, sometimes vague. Loyalties are at once well-defined, conflicting and confusing - does one follow the nature of one's Sept, Tribe, Auspice, Breed, Pack, or even oneself? Decisions are made with contemplation and anger, honor and savagery. Balance for the Changing Breed is a fleeting thing, difficult to achieve and easily lost. The Garou who walk this all-too-narrow path well are legendary, though sometimes not in their own lifetimes - many are the Garou whose wisdom, honor and glory are only recognized posthumously. Those who fail to hold their resolve fall into Harano, a deep depression that most often ends in the Garou's death, or, at worst, are lost to the Wyrm. \n\nWhether a Garou acts with quiet firmness, loud boisterousness, or be full of indecision finally leading to action, few will question her motives. Amongst the Garou, actions speak louder than thoughts or words. Each cub has the potential to be a hero, if she takes up that challenge. \n\nLoyalty\nBecause they are beset on all sides by the agents of the Wyrm and Weaver, Garou have developed a militaristic culture; whether it is the glorification of blood and heroes among the Get, the secretive machinations of the Shadow Lords, or the Children of Gaia bring peace to all Garou,, all tribes fight the good fight in their own way. Indeed, the similarities of Norse, Greek, Celtic  and underworld cultures to those of their respective tribes is a chicken-or-the-egg question debated by Galliards and Philodox - did the Garou influence the humans, or the humans influence the Garou? But when a Bane threatens the caern, all Garou will set aside their discussions to deal with the threat. \n\nThe law of the pack is a natural order, dynamic and strong. When it fails and a pack or sept or even the Garou Nation turns on itself, the results are often terrible. Fortunately, this rarely happens. Almost all Garou understand their role as defenders of Gaia, and most share the same goals: Protect the Wyld, defeat the Wyrm, and harness the Weaver or else defeat it as well. The Garou know that left unchecked, the unholy combination of the Weaver and Wyrm will destroy Gaia. This is a critical difference from the difficulties faced by some of the Garou's Kin over history - the Garou face the death of their race and their culture, while their kin and others faced only the destruction of their culture - certainly a fate worse than death to many of those who survived, but what of the White Howlers who were lost to the Wyrm and became the Black Spiral Dancers? Most Garou know that to prevent this, the Garou must work together. \n\nHowever, there are disagreements over how to achieve the goals, as well as their prioritization and sometimes even re-definition of the goals themselves. The Children of Gaia advocate turning the Wyrm, not destroying it, while the Get of Fenris fight the Wyrm with such Rage that they can end up needlessly fighting themselves and others. The Red Talons seek to restore the Impergium and cull humanity so as to save their wolf brothers. Fierce fighters of the Wyrm, the Black Furies will first and foremost seek to protect the sacred Wyld places. In some cases, Garou holding extreme viewpoints will see other Garou as traitors to their cause, or vice versa. The latter is the case with the Warders of Men, who are viewed by many Garou from rural sept's as lost to the Weaver, even though they do continue the fight against the Wyrm in their human cities. All tribes look with suspicion on the Silent Striders, who fight when they have to but otherwise move about on their own, away from pack and sept. The Fianna sometimes seem to enjoy life and family at the expense of other goals, while the Bone Gnawers seem to value survival above all else. \n\nEach breed, auspice, tribe, sept, and pack has its own viewpoint, creating difficulties for each Garou as loyalties come into conflict. Should one work to recover a powerful fetish, or find the Leeches who have taken control of a city, or make sure that the cubs are safe? The choices are hard, and rarely is there a \"right\" solution. The Garou recognize this by rewarding good choices with Renown and engaging in a constant process of teaching, tutoring and learning, whether it be studying under an elder Philodox, learning a Gift from a spirit, or telling a story at a moot. The bonds created by this process are reinforced within each pack by the shared experiences and history of the Garou in the pack. The result is an implicit trust of other Garou, and an explicit trust of one's packmates. \n\nInherently creatures of action, Garou have their debates, make decisions, and follow through on them. The Shadow Lord knows that once he has convinced the Silver Fang that it's right to begin watching an area suspected of Wyrm taint that the Silver Fang will support him, if at the least because he'll be expected to do the same for the Silver Fang later or else lose Honor. Whether for selfish or noble reasons, the loyalty amongst Garou is one of their most distinguishing features. A Garou trusts that when another Garou says she will do something, that task will be done. And that Garou trusts that having given her word that she'll complete a task, her word will be respected by other Garou and they won't butt in unless asked. \n\nThis loyalty to other Garou also extends to Kin and especially to cubs. Each tribe feels responsible for their Kin and watches out for them. Should a Kinfolk of unknown tribe become known, the tribe who found the Kin will take him or her in - there have been challenges over the rights to protect Kin when more than one Garou or tribe has claimed the honor. Cubs are the future of Garou, and Lost Cubs are especially treasured because they are gifts of Gaia to the Garou. All Garou will come to the aid of a cub, while letting a cub needlessly face danger is scandalous, causing loss of Honor and Wisdom. \n\nRomance\nGarou make for great fighters, great lovers, and lousy mates. Few manage to have any sort of romantic relationship that last more than a few months, many only have one-night stands. There are many reasons for this - duty, danger, the pack, and the changing forms. As warriors for Gaia, werewolves feel a higher purpose. Though it is a Garou's duty to breed, the higher priority is to battle the Wyrm and protect the Wyld, and therefore easy for a Garou to avoid, ignore, or forget the duty to reproduce. Like soldiers Garou face death on the line of duty every day, except that dangers for the Garou are much greater, the stresses on the Garou's mate (and the relationship) that much larger. Garou fight in packs, saving each other's lives, teaching on another, performing rituals, uncovering mysteries. The bond that is created amongst the pack is one that no outside romance can truly intrude on. In the mortal world, similar stresses are seen on relationships between soldiers on the one hand and civilians on the other. Finally, the Garou are not human or wolf, they are an amalgamation of both and few can overcome the difference. \n\nGiven the difficulties of having a relationship with a human or wolf, why bother? Generations of Galliards and human bards have sought the answer without success. It is clear that Garou will seek relationships when and where they can, just like humans and wolves. Breeding more Garou is a major part of these relationships. As Garou are only born of Garou/human or Garou/wolf matings (leaving aside the Metis), it is expected that Garou, male and female, will at some point seek out a human or wolf to mate with. Rarely is a Garou rejected in his or her advance, at the very least the Garou has a strong animal magnetism that will attract even the least interested, and at most/worst the Garou has the strength to get what he or she wants. Whether this coupling lasts beyond the act of intercourse depends on many factors, some Garou seek only to spread or receive seed, others seek a partner to help with the prospective child. Assuming there is a child; nine out of ten are Kinfolk and not Garou. Many werewolves will ignore and abandon those children to the original parent or some other means such as adoption or foster parents, preferring their Garou child. Even then, many Garou pay little attention, for the demands of the pack, sept, breed, tribe and auspice are great, never mind the dangers of breaking the Veil or drawing too much attention from the Wyrm to their children. Few Garou children know of their heritage prior to their First Change, most grow up with at least one non-biological parent. \n\nThings are a little different amongst the wolves. Normally, the alpha male of the pack mates with the alpha female and that is it. As even the youngest Garou is a match for either of the alphas, a werewolf could easily destroy the wolf pack's structure through carelessness, never mind that thoughts of bestiality exist in the minds of many city-born Garou. The fragility of the packs and the skill required to maintain them mean that the wolf-packs are carefully watched by their tribes, though it is fortunate that lupus Garou are the most fecund of all Garou. \n\nThe major difference between the Garou sexes is around the issue of pregnancy. While female Garou don't lose any effectiveness in battle until their ninth month (and some formerly-chauvinistic males would say not even then after being chastised for saying otherwise), the fact that they represent two Garou, one living and one unborn, makes them precious in the eyes of many. Some female Garou accept the \"protection\" of others, most rebel until they feel hampered by the growing child. \n\nThe Garou who successfully bring to term Garou children receive Honor Renown for following their duty, and the renown (or infamy) of their children follows Garou parents to the end of their days. Whether a Garou wants to have a child at a particular time is sometimes a moot point, for Gaia's seed is strong.\n\nWhen a Garou mates with a Garou, a Metis child can result. The Litany proscription against this mating came about for two reasons: First, to ensure that Garou did not lose contact with the human and wolf parts of their nature, and second, to prevent weakness within the Garou bloodlines. Garou who mate with other Garou aren't mating with humans and wolves, while the sterile, deformed products of that mating - the Metis - can't reproduce nor can they fight as well for Gaia. Never mind that sex between Garou is supposedly better than any other sort. \n\nAlthough the Litany clearly states that Metis are abhorrent, most Garou are not strangers to the temptation of intimate relationships with their Garou brothers and sisters. They attempt to respect the Litany and abhor romantic relationships from the very beginning, even homosexual ones because they distract the Garou from their mission. There are a few Garou who can understand these relationships forming - after all, the passion of the Garou and the bonds created through shared experiences are so strong that relationships deeper than friendships are almost certain to exist. Though they are more accepting of various emotions in these relationships, these understanding Garou draw the line at lust and physical passion, for Metis can result. Most of the Garou involved in relationships with other Garou feel guilt for their actions, causing relationships to form and fall apart in short order, and if they're lucky there will be no lasting repercussions. There are some who feel little to no guilt, saying the rewards are worth it, that a true match amongst Garou is better than any with a wolf or human. Those unrepentant Garou usually die horrible deaths for their loves and are the subjects of many a Galliard tale. \n\nAll Garou respect the strong bonds that exist between Garou who have fought and bled for (and with) one another. The Philodox and Ragabash are always on the lookout for Garou who take the bonds of pack, tribe, auspice and breed a step too far - those who do lose Honor and Renown. Full of passion and rage, the Ahroun are the guiltiest of these breaches, curiously followed by the Philodox, whose balance is apparently a fragile one. \n\nNo Garou should condone relationships with Metis, for even though there is no fear of offspring (though most Metis are capable of sex, just sterile) the relationship itself is a clear indication of distraction from following Gaia's will. This causes even more loneliness amongst the Metis, because few Garou will have more than a passing interaction with them, that usually being a negative interaction in the first place. \n\nSurvival\nGarou are perhaps the supreme predators of the planet, with all the benefits of their lupine and human heritage as well as the powers that Gaia bestowed - multiple forms, regeneration, stepping sideways, and gifts. However, the Garou must hide lest they be hunted themselves by agents of the Weaver or Wyrm, or even humans themselves. Wolf packs are hidden away in wild places; Caerns are hidden from Umbral and mundane sight. Most Garou live on the fringes of mortal society, using their wits and skills as well as the generosity of Kinfolk to survive. Only in the deep woods do Garou live like wolves, hunting and eating their kill, though the occasional Bone Gnawer will make a living off of rats and other vermin. All \nGarou will avoid eating humans, for therein lies madness. A Garou who feasts on humans will be put to death before his taint can spread to others. Given the basics of food, very little can harm a Garou - their robust bodies can tolerate extremes of cold and heat, are immune to many diseases, and Garou are strong & mean enough to take on most any natural beast. It is only from supernatural threats that Garou face any real danger.  \n\n{Original article provided by Embers and Embers Productions; edited by DarkPro ST and Galeroth - please place in acknowledgement folder}"

The Weaver is considered an unwitting ally or a slave to the Wyrm by most Garou, and so is a sort of blameless cause of Gaia's trouble. Consequently, most Garou view the Weaver with suspicion, a useful but dangerous aspect of Gaia. At worst, the Weaver is responsible for the Wyrm's madness. \nWyld - The personified force of creative chaos. The Wyld is associated with freedom, wilderness, randomness, and uncontrolled energy. It can be dangerously chaotic, but its diminished power in the modern world is considered even more dangerous by the Garou, as the Weaver and Wyrm have overpowered it. \nWyrm - The personified force of death, decay, disease, and corruption.

            "0": "What is Rage? It's not that simple a question. Unfortunately, many players tend not to think of it much beyond the thought of a possible frenzy when fighting. If asked, they may say something like \"It's what lets me go berserk.  Rage is a vital component of Werewolf: Dark Ages, and more than any other Trait, it defines what the Garou are. \n\nRage is that inner anger every Garou (and most other Changing Breeds) possess. It is a touch of the fury that Gaia feels at the destruction of the natural world, a fury she has shared with her children to motivate them in their war. It is a boiling cauldron of passion that lurks in every Garou's heart, and no matter how small it might be, it is there, and it is something the werewolf cannot ignore. \n\nWHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE? \nHave you ever been really angry? Now, I mean really, utterly pissed off? So mad you believed you could kill someone? That all you could think about was hurting who or whatever angered you? \n\nOkay, now take that and multiply it by 10, and then you'll come close to what your average Garou feels everyday. Rage is not something that can be ignored until you need it. It is always there, seething just under your other emotions. Ready to explode at a moment's notice. \n\nIt is much like a caged beast, the Beast Within, if you will. And the lock on that cage is pretty flimsy. It won't take much for that beast to bust out and wreck havoc. Rage is a ticking time bomb. It can and will blow up with little provocation. Frenzy can happen at any time in battle, when the lust for mayhem and the anger at your enemies grows too great.\n\nIt's like being a borderline psychopath, always having this maddening killing urge lurking just beneath the surface. Your vision runs red too easily. In short, Garou are not happy beings. Sure, they can experience joy and laughter like any other living being. They have a full range of emotions, but everything is tainted by their Rage. It's always there, and they always know it. \n\nLUNA'S BLESSING \nRage comes from Luna, the Celestine of the Moon, so the Garou legends say. She gifted the werewolves with this power in the beginning so that they may fight fiercely and never surrender. Fact supports this. The moon has a very acute affect on Rage. \n\nFirst, there is the affect the moon phase has on a Garou's attitude. The fuller the moon, the angrier the werewolf gets. When Luna shines her full face upon the world, the Garou are at their edgiest, ready to fly into frenzy at the drop of a hat. \n\nJust seeing Luna for the first time every night can cause a werewolf's rage to flood through there bodies. Their hearts tympani with the swelling of rage Luna brings. They say that it is Luna's way of reminding the werewolves, subconsciously, of what they fight for. \n\nTHE PRICE OF POWER \nBut of course, there is a price to pay. That cost is the ever growing chance that the Beast will get out of control. When the Beast has awakened too much, Frenzy occurs. Frenzies are when the Garou completely loses control of the Wolf in her heart and becomes nothing more than a berserk monster. Frenzies can only be halted by time. \n\nGarou do not approve of frenzies. It reminds them that they are not the noble heroes many of them like to see themselves as, and are instead bloodthirsty animals. It is a truth few of them enjoy contemplating. Friend, foe, innocent bystander....none of it matters to a frenzying werewolf. All are targets. All are enemies. Too often a Garou has come out of a frenzy to find she has slaughtered her own family. \n\nFrenzies become easier as Luna shows more of her face to the world. The time of the full moon is quite rightly feared by many humans. This is the time the Garou are at their edgiest, and their anger is ready to boil over at the drop of a hat. It has also been a noted fact that frenzies happen more often when a shape shifter is in Crinos form. It is a body designed for battle, and the Rage flows more easily in this form.  \n \n\nRECOVERING \nFrenzies last for as long as the werewolf senses danger. If the danger has passed, or if he has escaped from it, the Garou will come out of the frenzy after he has managed to calm down and catch his breath \n \n\nTHE WYRM AND RAGE \nThe Wyrm poisoned the Rage that Luna gifted to the Garou, the legends say. The Wyrm found out about Gaia and Luna's plan to craft her defenders, and the Wyrm secretly sabotaged the project by making sure their Rage would never be something the werewolves could control, by making it something that could drive them to acts they would despise themselves for. \n\nIn other words, like many other things, the Garou blame frenzies on the Wyrm. Yet there is some proof the back-up this knee-jerk reactionary claim. For sometimes, frenzy can get so out of hand that the werewolf becomes a monster that commits terrible depravities. This event is known as the Thrall of the Wyrm. \n\nThese abnormal frenzies are rare, but when they happen the sickening results cannot be denied. These are not just frenzies. They are acts of depravity and perversion, brought on by the Wyrm's influence of the werewolf's heart. \n\nStrangely, the Garou's breed has an effect on just what happens. It is said the Triatic Wyrms, the three faces of the Wyrm itself, enjoy prodding select breeds into particular perversions. \n\nHomids become cannibals, eating human, wolf and werewolf flesh with an unequaled gluttony. The Eater-of-Souls perverts the Homids, driving them to unholy consumptions. Lupus are taken over by the Beast-of-War, removing all traces of mercy, driving them to attack the weak and helpless, destroying even fellow pack mates if they are badly wounded. And the Defiler Wyrm, in perhaps the sickest event of all, pushes the Metis into disgusting acts of sexual obsession, even necrophilia. \n\nTHE CURSE \nThat weird guy in the corner that could be a serial killer with the way he looks at everyone. The girl next door that seems to be permanently PMSing. When a Garou feels angry, humans knows it. It makes them uneasy around the Garou, as they can sense the Beast. The instinctual reaction that inflicts the Delirium in humanity, the subconscious memory of the Impergium and the nights of terror it created, allows humans to notice that excessive Rage. \n\nGarou call it the Curse. It is why they must often live apart from humanity. Their Rage rarely allows them to fit in. Friendships and marriages to humans become hard as hell to maintain, the Rage always becoming a factor in the relationship. And when frenzies happen, as they always will, it can be nearly impossible for the humans in the Garou's life to forget or forgive the bloody horrors that usually result. Even with Kinfolk it is rarely easy. \n\nEven among wolves, it is never easy. Animals get uneasy around Garou with the Curse. Wolf packs shy away. It is only among each other that Garou find any peace, but even then their own laws forbid such relationships, for fear of the genetic dead-ends it produces. \n\nRage is a tool, it is a weapon, and it is a blessing. It is also a double-bladed sword, cutting the Garou as well as his enemies. It is a curse and a burden... one that cannot be gotten rid of. \n\nUse it well, and be careful. \n\nROLE-PLAYING RAGE \nIt doesn't happen often enough. Players tend to conveniently forget how Rage factors into their character's personality. Garou are not happy beings. They are very rarely in control of their emotions. They are passionate in the extreme. Players too often portray Garou as humans who can change shape and get extra actions in combat. \n\n{Original article written by Stormwalker; edited by DarkPro ST  needs to be placed on acknowledgement page and edited by Galeroth}"

            "0": "The Resolve of the Garou\nSimply put, the Garou are out to save the world, fighting the forces of corruption and stasis to save what remains of nature in a dark world. Though some could call this goal one of arrogance and hubris, the immense pride of the Garou comes from many sources. Of all the shape-changers, only the Garou run in packs and no others work as well together, though strife tears at this. Even before the Impergium, the Garou were more numerous and more widely traveled, living in Gaia's splendor in almost every location across the globe. Finally, each Garou is one of Gaia's Chosen, the final defense from the predations of the Wyrm. \n\nThough the goal is known, the means are the single most continuing point of debate. The line between friend and enemy is sometimes clear, sometimes vague. Loyalties are at once well-defined, conflicting and confusing - does one follow the nature of one's Sept, Tribe, Auspice, Breed, Pack, or even oneself? Decisions are made with contemplation and anger, honor and savagery. Balance for the Changing Breed is a fleeting thing, difficult to achieve and easily lost. The Garou who walk this all-too-narrow path well are legendary, though sometimes not in their own lifetimes - many are the Garou whose wisdom, honor and glory are only recognized posthumously. Those who fail to hold their resolve fall into Harano, a deep depression that most often ends in the Garou's death, or, at worst, are lost to the Wyrm. \n\nWhether a Garou acts with quiet firmness, loud boisterousness, or be full of indecision finally leading to action, few will question her motives. Amongst the Garou, actions speak louder than thoughts or words. Each cub has the potential to be a hero, if she takes up that challenge. \n\nLoyalty\nBecause they are beset on all sides by the agents of the Wyrm and Weaver, Garou have developed a militaristic culture; whether it is the glorification of blood and heroes among the Get, the secretive machinations of the Shadow Lords, or the Children of Gaia bring peace to all Garou,, all tribes fight the good fight in their own way. Indeed, the similarities of Norse, Greek, Celtic  and underworld cultures to those of their respective tribes is a chicken-or-the-egg question debated by Galliards and Philodox - did the Garou influence the humans, or the humans influence the Garou? But when a Bane threatens the caern, all Garou will set aside their discussions to deal with the threat. \n\nThe law of the pack is a natural order, dynamic and strong. When it fails and a pack or sept or even the Garou Nation turns on itself, the results are often terrible. Fortunately, this rarely happens. Almost all Garou understand their role as defenders of Gaia, and most share the same goals: Protect the Wyld, defeat the Wyrm, and harness the Weaver or else defeat it as well. The Garou know that left unchecked, the unholy combination of the Weaver and Wyrm will destroy Gaia. This is a critical difference from the difficulties faced by some of the Garou's Kin over history - the Garou face the death of their race and their culture, while their kin and others faced only the destruction of their culture - certainly a fate worse than death to many of those who survived, but what of the White Howlers who were lost to the Wyrm and became the Black Spiral Dancers? Most Garou know that to prevent this, the Garou must work together. \n\nHowever, there are disagreements over how to achieve the goals, as well as their prioritization and sometimes even re-definition of the goals themselves. The Children of Gaia advocate turning the Wyrm, not destroying it, while the Get of Fenris fight the Wyrm with such Rage that they can end up needlessly fighting themselves and others. The Red Talons seek to restore the Impergium and cull humanity so as to save their wolf brothers. Fierce fighters of the Wyrm, the Black Furies will first and foremost seek to protect the sacred Wyld places. In some cases, Garou holding extreme viewpoints will see other Garou as traitors to their cause, or vice versa. The latter is the case with the Warders of Men, who are viewed by many Garou from rural sept's as lost to the Weaver, even though they do continue the fight against the Wyrm in their human cities. All tribes look with suspicion on the Silent Striders, who fight when they have to but otherwise move about on their own, away from pack and sept. The Fianna sometimes seem to enjoy life and family at the expense of other goals, while the Bone Gnawers seem to value survival above all else. \n\nEach breed, auspice, tribe, sept, and pack has its own viewpoint, creating difficulties for each Garou as loyalties come into conflict. Should one work to recover a powerful fetish, or find the Leeches who have taken control of a city, or make sure that the cubs are safe? The choices are hard, and rarely is there a \"right\" solution. The Garou recognize this by rewarding good choices with Renown and engaging in a constant process of teaching, tutoring and learning, whether it be studying under an elder Philodox, learning a Gift from a spirit, or telling a story at a moot. The bonds created by this process are reinforced within each pack by the shared experiences and history of the Garou in the pack. The result is an implicit trust of other Garou, and an explicit trust of one's packmates. \n\nInherently creatures of action, Garou have their debates, make decisions, and follow through on them. The Shadow Lord knows that once he has convinced the Silver Fang that it's right to begin watching an area suspected of Wyrm taint that the Silver Fang will support him, if at the least because he'll be expected to do the same for the Silver Fang later or else lose Honor. Whether for selfish or noble reasons, the loyalty amongst Garou is one of their most distinguishing features. A Garou trusts that when another Garou says she will do something, that task will be done. And that Garou trusts that having given her word that she'll complete a task, her word will be respected by other Garou and they won't butt in unless asked. \n\nThis loyalty to other Garou also extends to Kin and especially to cubs. Each tribe feels responsible for their Kin and watches out for them. Should a Kinfolk of unknown tribe become known, the tribe who found the Kin will take him or her in - there have been challenges over the rights to protect Kin when more than one Garou or tribe has claimed the honor. Cubs are the future of Garou, and Lost Cubs are especially treasured because they are gifts of Gaia to the Garou. All Garou will come to the aid of a cub, while letting a cub needlessly face danger is scandalous, causing loss of Honor and Wisdom. \n\nRomance\nGarou make for great fighters, great lovers, and lousy mates. Few manage to have any sort of romantic relationship that last more than a few months, many only have one-night stands. There are many reasons for this - duty, danger, the pack, and the changing forms. As warriors for Gaia, werewolves feel a higher purpose. Though it is a Garou's duty to breed, the higher priority is to battle the Wyrm and protect the Wyld, and therefore easy for a Garou to avoid, ignore, or forget the duty to reproduce. Like soldiers Garou face death on the line of duty every day, except that dangers for the Garou are much greater, the stresses on the Garou's mate (and the relationship) that much larger. Garou fight in packs, saving each other's lives, teaching on another, performing rituals, uncovering mysteries. The bond that is created amongst the pack is one that no outside romance can truly intrude on. In the mortal world, similar stresses are seen on relationships between soldiers on the one hand and civilians on the other. Finally, the Garou are not human or wolf, they are an amalgamation of both and few can overcome the difference. \n\nGiven the difficulties of having a relationship with a human or wolf, why bother? Generations of Galliards and human bards have sought the answer without success. It is clear that Garou will seek relationships when and where they can, just like humans and wolves. Breeding more Garou is a major part of these relationships. As Garou are only born of Garou/human or Garou/wolf matings (leaving aside the Metis), it is expected that Garou, male and female, will at some point seek out a human or wolf to mate with. Rarely is a Garou rejected in his or her advance, at the very least the Garou has a strong animal magnetism that will attract even the least interested, and at most/worst the Garou has the strength to get what he or she wants. Whether this coupling lasts beyond the act of intercourse depends on many factors, some Garou seek only to spread or receive seed, others seek a partner to help with the prospective child. Assuming there is a child; nine out of ten are Kinfolk and not Garou. Many werewolves will ignore and abandon those children to the original parent or some other means such as adoption or foster parents, preferring their Garou child. Even then, many Garou pay little attention, for the demands of the pack, sept, breed, tribe and auspice are great, never mind the dangers of breaking the Veil or drawing too much attention from the Wyrm to their children. Few Garou children know of their heritage prior to their First Change, most grow up with at least one non-biological parent. \n\nThings are a little different amongst the wolves. Normally, the alpha male of the pack mates with the alpha female and that is it. As even the youngest Garou is a match for either of the alphas, a werewolf could easily destroy the wolf pack's structure through carelessness, never mind that thoughts of bestiality exist in the minds of many city-born Garou. The fragility of the packs and the skill required to maintain them mean that the wolf-packs are carefully watched by their tribes, though it is fortunate that lupus Garou are the most fecund of all Garou. \n\nThe major difference between the Garou sexes is around the issue of pregnancy. While female Garou don't lose any effectiveness in battle until their ninth month (and some formerly-chauvinistic males would say not even then after being chastised for saying otherwise), the fact that they represent two Garou, one living and one unborn, makes them precious in the eyes of many. Some female Garou accept the \"protection\" of others, most rebel until they feel hampered by the growing child. \n\nThe Garou who successfully bring to term Garou children receive Honor Renown for following their duty, and the renown (or infamy) of their children follows Garou parents to the end of their days. Whether a Garou wants to have a child at a particular time is sometimes a moot point, for Gaia's seed is strong.\n\nWhen a Garou mates with a Garou, a Metis child can result. The Litany proscription against this mating came about for two reasons: First, to ensure that Garou did not lose contact with the human and wolf parts of their nature, and second, to prevent weakness within the Garou bloodlines. Garou who mate with other Garou aren't mating with humans and wolves, while the sterile, deformed products of that mating - the Metis - can't reproduce nor can they fight as well for Gaia. Never mind that sex between Garou is supposedly better than any other sort. \n\nAlthough the Litany clearly states that Metis are abhorrent, most Garou are not strangers to the temptation of intimate relationships with their Garou brothers and sisters. They attempt to respect the Litany and abhor romantic relationships from the very beginning, even homosexual ones because they distract the Garou from their mission. There are a few Garou who can understand these relationships forming - after all, the passion of the Garou and the bonds created through shared experiences are so strong that relationships deeper than friendships are almost certain to exist. Though they are more accepting of various emotions in these relationships, these understanding Garou draw the line at lust and physical passion, for Metis can result. Most of the Garou involved in relationships with other Garou feel guilt for their actions, causing relationships to form and fall apart in short order, and if they're lucky there will be no lasting repercussions. There are some who feel little to no guilt, saying the rewards are worth it, that a true match amongst Garou is better than any with a wolf or human. Those unrepentant Garou usually die horrible deaths for their loves and are the subjects of many a Galliard tale. \n\nAll Garou respect the strong bonds that exist between Garou who have fought and bled for (and with) one another. The Philodox and Ragabash are always on the lookout for Garou who take the bonds of pack, tribe, auspice and breed a step too far - those who do lose Honor and Renown. Full of passion and rage, the Ahroun are the guiltiest of these breaches, curiously followed by the Philodox, whose balance is apparently a fragile one. \n\nNo Garou should condone relationships with Metis, for even though there is no fear of offspring (though most Metis are capable of sex, just sterile) the relationship itself is a clear indication of distraction from following Gaia's will. This causes even more loneliness amongst the Metis, because few Garou will have more than a passing interaction with them, that usually being a negative interaction in the first place. \n\nSurvival\nGarou are perhaps the supreme predators of the planet, with all the benefits of their lupine and human heritage as well as the powers that Gaia bestowed - multiple forms, regeneration, stepping sideways, and gifts. However, the Garou must hide lest they be hunted themselves by agents of the Weaver or Wyrm, or even humans themselves. Wolf packs are hidden away in wild places; Caerns are hidden from Umbral and mundane sight. Most Garou live on the fringes of mortal society, using their wits and skills as well as the generosity of Kinfolk to survive. Only in the deep woods do Garou live like wolves, hunting and eating their kill, though the occasional Bone Gnawer will make a living off of rats and other vermin. All \nGarou will avoid eating humans, for therein lies madness. A Garou who feasts on humans will be put to death before his taint can spread to others. Given the basics of food, very little can harm a Garou - their robust bodies can tolerate extremes of cold and heat, are immune to many diseases, and Garou are strong & mean enough to take on most any natural beast. It is only from supernatural threats that Garou face any real danger.  \n\n{Original article provided by Embers and Embers Productions; edited by DarkPro ST and Galeroth - please place in acknowledgement folder}"

The Weaver is considered an unwitting ally or a slave to the Wyrm by most Garou, and so is a sort of blameless cause of Gaia's trouble. Consequently, most Garou view the Weaver with suspicion, a useful but dangerous aspect of Gaia. At worst, the Weaver is responsible for the Wyrm's madness. \nWyld - The personified force of creative chaos. The Wyld is associated with freedom, wilderness, randomness, and uncontrolled energy. It can be dangerously chaotic, but its diminished power in the modern world is considered even more dangerous by the Garou, as the Weaver and Wyrm have overpowered it. \nWyrm - The personified force of death, decay, disease, and corruption.

            "0": "When a Garou mates with another Garou and a child is born, the result is a Metis - a sterile, deformed Garou born in Crinos form. The fact that metis are born disfigured is proof enough for most Garou that such offspring are somehow tainted by the Wyrm. A metis in this day and age is rarely allowed to exist past its birth, and its parents often times punished by death for breaking the litany. \n\nBut moreso than their genetics, metis are considered the cursed of Gaia because of the sin that causes their births - their parents' mating was and is proscribed by the Litany, and is considered a perversion amongst the Garou. That sin is a stigma that usually follows metis for the rest of their lives, as they live in constant punishment for crimes in which they played no part. They are a living reminder of the temptations that Garou face on a daily basis, and are reviled for it. Naturally, metis' relationships with their parents tend to be strained by guilt and blame, fostering very little if any love, should the parents be allowed to live. Relationships with other Garou are typically marked by wilful ignorance, harassment, and abuse on the part of the other Garou, who only tolerate the metis because they can be valuable to the Sept. Because of this dysfunctional upbringing, many metis grown up hostile and cruel, which only seems to reinforce the negative stereotypes. Those who do not are tragic figures indeed.\n\nRequirements-\nNon- Evil\nNo Class Restrictions"

            "0": "Homid Garou are born to a human or homid mother and suffer from her lack of connection to Gaia. Because humanity has separated itself from the Wyld and become more focused upon the trials and tribulations of civilization, members of the homid breed are disassociated from their wild inner selves.\n\nThis is why so many homids are Lost Cubs who do not know their true heritage. Though often the First Change is foreshadowed by nightmarish dreams and uncontrollable emotional states, too many times it comes unexpectedly, in a strange place, without the aid of other Garou. The shock of it can drive an unprepared new Garou into Lunacy, becoming prey for the Wyrm if they are not found and adopted into a tribe or pack. But regardless of where they end up, even homid Garou will never feel fully accepted into mundane society once their Garou nature has emerged.\n\nYet homids are the most adaptable and complex breed, having a better understanding of the trappings of societies and customs of man and holding the widest variety of opinions on Gaia. Homid Garou are also the most common breed, and on that count enjoy some measure of majority status in the septs and tend to have more Rank. They also have a better mind for learning languages, be they those of men or wolves. They have greater capacity to understand abstract reasoning than either the metis or lupus. Homids keep stronger relationships with their Kinfolk, although they also tend to have the most estrangement - humans, even Kinfolk, seem to never fully accept the violent nature of Garou.\n\nFor their diversity and privilege, however, homids as a whole seem to be caught up more in their complexities. They can clearly identify the wrongs of the destruction of the Wyld wrought by human society, but yet cannot often bring themselves to destroy humanity or otherwise bring them to heel. Their breed sentimentality runs deep and unsurprisingly, they are the most vocal proponents on the matters of the Litany's laws on protecting humans. This quandary of protection and destruction creates guilt in many homids that ends up being expressed at the other breeds. Some homids even put forth the idea that those breeds incapable of propagating themselves will die out as a matter social Darwinism.\n\nRural homids have a great distaste for the concrete and steel chasms of the city, lliving much more easily in the wild. They have enough knowledge of camping, hunting, and trapping to survive and prosper in the wilderness, and usually assume the most situation-advantageous form for whatever they are doing. They often feel that their homid breed prevents them from having a deeper connection to nature. Therefore, what little connection they do have is precious to them, sometimes to the annoyance of the other breeds. Not necessarily the crunchy-granola stereotypes, rural homids strive to accept their role in nature as bridging the gap between the human and wolf worlds. They tend to view technology by necessity, if at all - if a Weavertool isn't used on a regular basis in the fight against the Wyrm, then it is most likely not needed. \n\nCity homids tend to be a bit nervous in the wild and have become unaccustomed to changing forms out of concerns of protecting the Veil. Unlike their rural counterparts, city-dwellers tend to be comfortable with technology, some even indulging in the latest and greatest accoutrements without a second thought. Their interpretation of the Litany tends to be more flexible than most, mainly because their environment is often a compromise between the Wyld and the Weaver - one that sometimes encourages disillusionment and reevaluation. Most city homids regard this philosophy as one geared towards necessary adaptability, viewing the rural homids as backwards cousins from the woods.\n\nHomids tend to view crinos form as a sign of impending (or actual) battle. It is often considered akin to crying \"Fire\" in a crowded theatre to run around in crinos form and thus a measure of responsibility is expected. Most rural homids and almost all city homids are not very comfortable in lupus form, finding the demands of instinct strange and having difficulty thinking and reasoning in complex situations. Therefor homids will generally only use the lupus form when absolutely necessary to chase prey, pass by unnoticed or for long runs. Most homids will anticipate the need for a change of form and do it in advance, rather than waiting until the last moment as other breeds will.\n\nAttitudes towards other breeds:\n\nLupus: It is common for homid Garou to be \"sensitive\" to the plights befalling the wolf population, though at times this concern appears to be nothing more than a tissue held out to assuage guilty feelings over the destruction of wolf packs and habitats. Lupus Garou are often treasured members of the sept and well-regarded. Despite that interest, there always seem to be distances in \n"

The parents are highly punished, in most cases by death.\n\nMetis will rarely advance in rank and will not be treated well by others of their kin. There are a few exceptions in some tribes but these cases are extremely rare.\n\nIt is not recommended to be a Metis unless you truly understand them and have a well thought out history and background for them. \n\n-Metis-\nWhen a Garou mates with another Garou and a child is born, the result is a Metis - a sterile, deformed Garou born in Crinos form. The fact that metis are born disfigured is proof enough for most Garou that such offspring are somehow tainted by the Wyrm. A metis in this day and age is rarely allowed to exist past its birth, and its parents often times punished by death for breaking the litany. \n\nBut moreso than their genetics, metis are considered the cursed of Gaia because of the sin that causes their births - their parents' mating was and is proscribed by the Litany, and is considered a perversion amongst the Garou. That sin is a stigma that usually follows metis for the rest of their lives, as they live in constant punishment for crimes in which they played no part. They are a living reminder of the temptations that Garou face on a daily basis, and are reviled for it. Naturally, metis' relationships with their parents tend to be strained by guilt and blame, fostering very little if any love, should the parents be allowed to live. Relationships with other Garou are typically marked by wilful ignorance, harassment, and abuse on the part of the other Garou, who only tolerate the metis because they can be valuable to the Sept. Because of this dysfunctional upbringing, many metis grown up hostile and cruel, which only seems to reinforce the negative stereotypes. Those who do not are tragic figures indeed.\n\nDespite their stigma, metis usually grow up fully aware of their Garou heritage, and have the unmistakable proof of their natural Crinos form that they are Garou from the day they are born. This headstart in the world of Garou is a powerful thing, because metis do not have to go through the traumatic First Change as homids or lupus do, and they often begin learning Gifts even before they show signs of changing. Metis sometimes take their first trips into the Umbra as children, as it is a simple thing for them to step sideways even before they first learn to walk. It is a good thing that a metis has Garou parents; not many human parents could handle a toddler whose natural form is a growling Crinos. Garou mothers usually assume Crinos form in order to give birth to a metis, but the birth is always difficult and dangerous.\n\nMetis endure more scrutiny than the other breeds and those metis caught violating of the Litany are shown little latitude. And when Renown is to be awarded for deeds done, metis are held to a stricter definition than the other breeds. Any respect for metis most likely comes from their packs, who bear witness to and benefit most from their (often unrecognized) contributions. Also, due to their almost guaranteed omega status, metis form easy relationships with the Sept Kinfolk.\n\nMetis are, by nature, infertile and have at least one disfigurement that is always physically detrimental. This deformity follows them in some fashion regardless of the form they assume. Metis enjoy the major benefits of each form and have perhaps the best understanding of the value each form has to what it means to be Garou. \n\nWere the Veil not threatened by their natural form, metis would almost always choose to exist in their native crinos form. They, like most Garou, simply feel more at ease in it. Moreover, the metis tend to be stronger in crinos form than the other breeds, giving them distinct natural battle advantages.\n\nAttitudes towards other breeds:\nHomid: When homids aren't insinuating, insulting, or abusing the metis and call themselves friends, they still flinch when touched and change the subject when personal matters are discussed. Metis don't hold out much hope that the situation will ever change, but continue to push the \"breeders\" for acceptance.\nLupus: Metis who have not become so self-absorbed as to be on the edge of Harano generally appreciate might find sympathy for the lupus, who in some areas are rare. The basic directness of lupus - the fact that a lupus will tell a metis he doesn't like him to his face, while a homid would just stare or look the other way - is much easier for metis to deal with.\n"

Though often the First Change is foreshadowed by nightmarish dreams and uncontrollable emotional states, too many times it comes unexpectedly, in a strange place, without the aid of other Garou. The shock of it can drive an unprepared new Garou into Lunacy, becoming prey for the Wyrm if they are not found and adopted into a tribe or pack. But regardless of where they end up, even homid Garou will never feel fully accepted into mundane society once their Garou nature has emerged.\n\nRestrictions-\nNon-Evil\nNo Class Restrictions"

            "0": "Lupus are born when one parent is a Garou and the other is a wolf. \n\nAs homid Garou have all of the schizophrenic complexity found in humans (and more), so do lupus Garou have the depth of instinct and connection to Gaia found in wolves. To understand what it means to be a lupus Garou (or take the lupus form) is to understand the nature of the wolf.\n\nWhile humans are born largely incapable of thought, speech or movement other than that of the bowels and take over a decade to reach maturity, wolves are fully-functioning members of their packs within months. Most of the time it takes for a lupus Garou to become a member of Garou society is used in understanding the ways of humans, which are difficult to master for those used to acting by instinct.\n\nWolves are nocturnal or crepuscular (meaning that they come out at twilight), although daytime activity is not uncommon, especially during cool weather or in the winter. Wolves and their Garou cousins are often night creatures, tending to be sluggish and sleepy during the day. They are almost entirely carnivorous. Some lupus Garou have adapted enough to eat foods other than meat, but they usually like their meat bloody, warm, and freshly killed.\n\nWolves posture to show dominance; the most common social ritual is to place one's paw on another wolf as that wolf rolls over to accept dominance. Wolves and lupus also mark possessions and territories with their scent glands. The dominant members of a wolf pack are the alpha male and alpha female, and all other wolves in the pack know their place, all the way down to the omega wolf. In a wolf pack, only the alpha pair breeds with wolves and this pair also suppresses breeding by all other pack members. \nHowever, all pack members help care for pups and feed them as well. Because of her size and strength, a lupus Garou will certainly dominate any wolf pack she is a member of. In a pack composed of lupus Garou it is not uncommon to have wolves that are Kinfolk as members, for lupus readily accept their Kin and have easier relations with them than any other breed.\n\nWolves do not communicate as humans do - while the written alphabet and human language are constructs, wolves communicate with their very being. Howling, barking, growling, whining, posturing and marking territory with their scent glands are the ways they use to get their point across. The subtleties of the wolf-tongue are difficult for humans to understand - enormous amounts of communication can occur through the position of the tail, the shape of the eyes, and the ruff of the fur. Wolves howl during courtship and mating, as a warning, as part of worshipping the moon, and in celebration. Barking is associated with surprise and warning. Growling occurs during challenges and is associated with threatening behavior asserting one's rights. Whines are associated with greetings, hungry cubs, playtime, and other signs of anxiety, curiosity, or inquiry. These are intimate noises that lupus Garou make to other wolves and to each other. When they do speak, they tend to speak truthfully and directly, with little flattery, irony, sarcasm or metaphor. To learn human tongues, lupus Garou must painstakingly take homid form and learn the concepts in addition to making the strange sounds with the mouth. Should another Garou take the lupus form to communicate with a lupus, the lupus will thank the Garou and take it as a sign of respect.\n\nWithin the world of the wolf and other creatures of Gaia, something is or it is not. What is not appears as if it does not exist in the wolf's universe, ignored by the wolf until it is time for a change. A wolf pack may loll around in full view of a herd of elk, each ignoring the other until the hunt begins. A wolf may chase a deer for miles and miles through winter woods and have it in reach throughout, but not deliver the killing blow until the time is right - until the deer is fully prey. To the wolf, something is food or not-food, prey or not-prey, a threat or not-threat. These distinctions may change quickly, though how they change is not always clear to humans. With this connection to Gaia, lupus have an intuitive understanding of nature's balance between the Weaver, Wyrm and Wyld that is envied by the other breeds.\n\nDespite the apparent simplicity of the wolve's world, they are capable of great cunning. For instance, while very single-minded in hunting prey, they are capable of a lot of thinking and strategizing in order to achieve their goals. But unless it is clear that fighting a foe is necessary, wolves are more likely try to escape unwanted encounters. Inherently creatures of the present, wolves generally have a hard time considering their action in terms of future results and results of past actions. They live in the present for the most part, and often take the most logical, most commonsensical course of action, rather than involve themselves in complicated schemes. They do not often make elaborate plans; instinct usually guides them. Wolves tend to consider prey and food higher priority over vanity. Though the social hierarchy and even to some extent ambition is important to them, the ambition is not usually for others' regard so much as it is for consideration and leadership. Lupus rarely hold a grudge or lingering resentment beyond the resolution of the issue at hand; when they do, their strength of feeling and action seems irrational to humans - witness the genocidal actions of the Red Talons.\n\nLupus have difficulty understanding many human concepts. The concept of time is challenging for lupus, as are the concepts of property and money - in the latter cases, lupus end up mapping some concepts of territory in order to understand them. Human laws and bureaucracy are usually alien to lupus Garou, while \"monkey-toys\" or \"Weavertools\" (otherwise known as technology) are not highly valued. This should not be mistaken for an inability to learn - though it can be a hair-raising experience for the teacher, lupus are entirely capable of mastering complex skills. Those few lupus raised in the city typically have a better understanding of human concepts, though at the cost of self-hatred and other maladies due to their caged upbringings.\n\nLupus believe that Gaia watches over them and protects them as She does all living things. They are perhaps the most spiritual of the breeds. They are known to respect Theurges of all breeds more than they do other auspices, and they show respect for all spirits encountered in the Umbra. They also hold strongly to those portions of the Litany that address respect and territory.\n\nLupus are hesitant to take the crinos form unless they need to and even then then will shift back as soon as it is convenient - a philosophy driven by their very present-tense outlook. Lupus will only take homid form when necessary to communicate with humans or to move through crowds of humans. While in homid form, lupus often feel their senses of smell and hearing dampened and are generally disoriented, needing constant correction and 'parenting' from their homid counterparts in order to fit in.\n\nAttitudes towards other breeds:\n\nHomids: Lupus will sometimes have trouble discerning one human from another, being thrown by the strong Weaver and Wyrm-smells on most humans and the customs of clothing - especially when it is brightly colored. Lupus tend to regard homids with a sense of disbelief, often confused by their constant quibbling over matters such as the Litany which seem, to lupus thought, to be quite clear. When homid debating doesn't hinder the issue at hand, it is common for lupus Garou to watch homids as a humorous form of entertainment.\n\nMetis: Lupus tend not to tolerate weakness, so they feel that metis should prove themselves. However, once they have done so to their (arguably more objective than homid) satisfaction, metis are more accepted, albeit grudgingly. understanding between homids and the wolfen perspective of the lupus.\n"
