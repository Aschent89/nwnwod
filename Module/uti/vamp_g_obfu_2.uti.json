      "0": "Obfuscate is a Discipline that allows vampires to conceal themselves and create some manner of illusions. It is one of the more popular Disciplines practiced by Cainites, and is the source of legends surrounding the ability of vampires to vanish and appear seemingly from nowhere. Obfuscate is mentally based; its powers achieve their effects by manipulating the minds of others, not in creating any real changes, and thus will not work against creatures immune to such mental effects. Generally, this is played out as the Nosferatu becoming \"part of the environment\"; any observers technically see the vampire, but the bloodsucker's presence simply does not register in their minds. They appear to be perfectly natural and in-place within the environment, the equivalent of a piece of furniture or yet another tree. Secondarily, this is played out as the vampire simply erasing their appearance from the minds of everyone who could see the vampire. It takes a very, very keen mind to avoid succumbing to this manipulation - that is why a high Perception is neccessary. The target must perceive that they are being manipulated in the first place, and then be able to perceive the vampire. "
