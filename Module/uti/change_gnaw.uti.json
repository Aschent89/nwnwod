Make sure you read your journal when you shift into any shape they all have there own rules to keep in the spirit of good role play.\n                     \nAs hungry mutts, the Bone Gnawers have survived for centuries using their canny ability to sniff out food and sneak about unseen. It's possible that they were originally of jackal stock, although their legends say that they were the \"runt\" of the litter back in the old days: young, tough, and stringy. Today, they are all too used to the role of convenient scapegoats. Few Bone Gnawers have gained enough Renown to play in the greater political field of the Septs and Grand Moots. \n\nThroughout history, Bone Gnawers have followed the dispossessed and the homeless. They hate slavery and oppression in general, but they're often too busy surviving to care about subtleties of Garou politics. They are allied with all the dogs in any given city through a complex system of communication called the \"Barking Chain\". They also know the dark places in the city that are ignored, reviled, or just too dangerous for the uninitiated of the street. Because of this, the Bone Gnawers are well informed about what goes on in the streets of any metropolitan area. This is as much a survival tactic as it is a strategic activity: they need to know when it's time to flee a sinking ship once things go wrong.\n\nThere are some Bone Gnawers who feel that the ship is sinking, and not just Boston, but all of Gaia. These Seekers speak a tale of a newly reborn Gaia deep in the Umbra, far away from the rotting carcass that is this world. It is attitudes like this that encourage most tribes to look down upon the Bone Gnawers as dirty, hungry, and without dedication to the battle with the Wyrm. They would argue that they are simply very practical and thus tend to ignore the more high-minded tribes, even making fun of them from time to time. Ignoring old Garou traditions in favor of practicality often gets the Gnawers in trouble, such as their disregard for the ban on inter-Garou sexual relations. Indeed Metis are received better by the Bone Gnawers than by any other tribe save the Black Spiral Dancers, a comparison not lost on their critics.\n\nWhile the Bone Gnawers are held as the lowest of the low of the Garou, they treat their own Kinfolk more as equals. This can be mystifying to some other tribes, for whom Kinfolk are lessers, usable primarily as breeding stock and for favors in the mortal world. Indeed the familial bonds between a Bone Gnawer and her extended family rival that of the intensely loyal Fianna.\n\nGnawers tend to collect things that they find of interest - trinkets and toys, places and people, and, more importantly, information. They are packrats every sense of the word, as all good followers of Rat should be.  After all, information is an invaluable commodity; they are excellent survivors, and have learned to live in harmony with all the dwellers of the city, including Kindred.  To this day, their relations with the Nosferatu are excellent.\n"
