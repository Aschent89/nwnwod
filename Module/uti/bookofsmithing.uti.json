It can also make you a substantial amount of gold if you are diligent about your business.\n- To Find Ore you have to Prospect for it. When you think you have found some Ore, Open the ORM and choose the Prospecting option. If you have enough Lore Skill you will indentify all Ore within 5 Meters.\n\n\nHow to gather ore:\nOnce you have identified an Ore you will have to put your back to work. There are 4 types of veins of ore, each have varying difficulties mining them. Adamantine (Rare), Mithril (Rare), Steel, and Iron (Both Abundant).\n\nNOTE: Steel is actually made from Iron and Coal....but for the simplicity of our adventuring and how Crafting is Set Up by Bioware.....Steel is an Ore.\n\nYou will need the right tool for the right job. There are two weapons...Mining Pick...and Light Mining Pick. Available at a general supply store. These will break every so often.\n\nEach ore has a damage requirement that continues to add with every stroke you hit it. Overcome this requirement and you will receive an ore chunk. If you have the Mining Pick (Large one) you can gain an additional chunk 50% of the time.\n\nIt would be recommendable to get yourself a Pack Animal to help carry your heavy burdens.\n\nSmelting the Ore:\nOnce you have gathered ore...place the ore in the Smelting Forge. You will need 5 chunks of ore to make a bar of metal.\n\nThere is also a maximum capacity of ore that the forge can handle. Just plop ore in and it will tell you if you have to much...nice. If you have enough skill from your Armor or Weapon skill points plus a d20 Roll you will succeed at smelting the ore.\n\nNOTE: The Smelting Forge will stay locked for 10 Seconds.\n\n\nCrafting Items (Including the DC and Cost):\n\nFirst thing you need is a Crafting Anvil. Just step up to it (there is a black spot) then right click on the whatever you are trying to craft. You will see the options available on each and every item activated. There is also a cost for each item crafted because of consumables you don't have to worry about. The Anvil is only for metal objects BUT any item can be crafted here....even the wooden ones.\n\nThe Base Items you need (For the creation of planks and wooden items see the Book of Woodworking):\n\nMaterials:\nBar of Adamantine\nBar of Mithril\nBar of Steel\nBar of Iron\nLeather Hide\nBolt of Cloth\nFeathers (Used for Helmets)\n\nBase Component/DC/Cost:\n\nFrom Steel:\nHelmet Pot/12/1 -
