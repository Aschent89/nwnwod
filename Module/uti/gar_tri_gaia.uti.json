The female 'Voice of Gaia' and the male 'Arm of Gaia'. Besides that their septs have the usual offices. There are no regular global moots or over-regional leaders known. \n\nAs part of their peace-loving nature, the Children of Gaia frequently work with and through human environmental organizations. They are the Garou that tend to work with the govenments of humans, pushing through pro-environment laws and regulations as often as they can. \n"
