There is no room for cowardace or indecisiveness among the Fenrir, and retreat is not in their vocabulary. \n\nThe Fenrir is one of the most selective tribes when it comes to chosing members. A potential Fenrir must prove themselves to the rest of the tribe, even if they are born into it. The Rite of Passage for Fenrir cubs is one of the bloodiest and most brutal of rites, and even after they have passed, they are continously tested to improve their battle skills and ability to survive. Weak Fenrir cubs are usually abandoned or, in more recent times, turned over to other tribes to be raised. Some Get also practice a belief in the purity of blood as a sign of worthiness. \n\nThe Fenrir are extremely harsh towards female members, but some female Fenrir have had a chance to prove themselves to be as heroic and fierce in battle as the tribe's male members. \n\nReligious Culture\n\n One of the most common practices of the Fenrir is the recitation of skalds, or epics of past Garou who have proven themselves worthy of heroism. Most Fenrir also strongly believe in fate, believing they are destined to die fighting for a worthy cause. \n"
