The 2.36-Inch Smoke Rocket M10 and its improved subvariants used the rocket motor and fin assembly of the M6A1, but replaced the anti-tank warhead with a white phosphorus smoke head. This not only acts as a visible screen, but its burning particles can cause burns on human skin. The 2.36-Inch Incendiary Rocket T31 was an M10 variant with an incendiary warhead designed to ignite fires in enemy-held structures and unarmored vehicles, or to destroy combustible supplies, ammunition, and material.\n\nT61 rounds damage the immediate target physically and through fire, but also cause fire damage to targets in the immediate vicinity."
