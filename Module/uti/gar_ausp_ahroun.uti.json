Garou under this auspice have the most potential rage of all Garou, making them fast and unshakable in combat.\n\nAhrouns can often be easy to anger as they have such high rage. Their rage can often be felt by human and kin easily. While it does not overly effect kinfolk it will make human's shy away and fear the Ahroun. Ahrouns rage is at its peak when the full moon is present and it is in that time that they are often easier to upset. \n\nBut to not mistake that their rage makes the unthinking, unfeeling monsters. They can be very caring and protective people, and make great strategies they are just more likely to act before they think through all of it."
