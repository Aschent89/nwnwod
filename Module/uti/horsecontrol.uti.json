Treat it right and you will have a loyal companion!\n\nTo Use:\nTarget Yourself - \n\n1A) This sets the Horse to follow you. This is module wide so if you are in a different area.....no problem.\n\nNOTE: While in Follow Mode the Horse will try to Follow YOU....that means when you get into a Fight the Horse WILL ALSO FIGHT....BUT....since it is tracking you it cannot fight as efficiently! Put the Horse into Defend Mode when this happens!\n\n1B) This ALSO will dismount you from the Horse.\n\n2) If you have logged in and do not have the Horse simply target yourself and the Animal will come to your side.\n\nTargetting the Ground (While Walking) -\n\nThis Sets a location where the Horse will go and enter Defend Mode. While in Defend Mode the Horse WILL Fight and protect itself! \n\n\nTargetting the Ground (While Mounted) -\n\nIf you are more than 20M away from the Location (Practice) you will initiate a Calvary Charge. You will charge to the Location and every creature within 5M of that location will feel the effect! You can also FALL OFF the Horse while doing this!\n\n\nTrampling Your Enemy!! Nothing for you to do except get into Melee. The Horse will take care of itself for you!\n\nLogging Off:\n\nWhen you Log off the Horse will automatically despawn and wait for your return.\n"
