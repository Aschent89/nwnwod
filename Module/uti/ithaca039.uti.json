      "0": "Ammo Caliber: Shotgun\n\nThe Ithaca model 37 shotgun is one of the oldest pump action shotguns still in production. It was introduced in the 1937, and was based on the design patented by John M. Browning in 1915 and improved by Harry Howland of Ithaca Gun Co in 1931. Originally Browning sold his design to the Remington Arms Co, but later Ithaca Gun Company bought this design from Remington and began to build its own shotguns. Model 37 is known for its light weight and ambidextrous handling, thanks to Browning's patented bottom ejection feature. It is available in numerous versions and in various calibers, but for police, security and defense use most suitable are 12 gauge versions. Current production model 37 \"Homeland Security\" is intended for civilian self-defense use, and also can be used as a police weapon. Special, more compact version was developed especially for police use and is known as Model 37 \"Stakeout\". This gun features a shorter barrel and a pistol grip instead of more common butt. Model 37 was widely used by various police departments and security units in the USA, and still popular enough. \n\nModel 37 is a conventional, manually operated pump action shotgun. It uses tubular underbarrel magazine that can hold 4 rounds in standard configuration. The barrel locking is achieved by tipping the rear part of the bolt up, into the recess in the receiver roof. The receiver is made from steel and strong enough to handle 3 inch magnum shells (modern versions only!) but yet light enough. Cross-bolt, push button type manual safety is located in the triggerguard, behind the trigger. The most famous feature of the Model 37 is its bottom ejection system, designed by Browning. The same window at the bottom of the receiver is used to load the magazine and to eject the spent cartridges. Model 37 shotguns usually are equipped with simple bead sights and wooden furniture. "
