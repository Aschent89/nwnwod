All versions may be equipped with silencers.\nSome sources also reported that IMI developed a variant of Micro-UZI with charging handle located at the left side of the receiver and the picatinny-style rails on the top and on the bottom of the receiver. The rals are used to mount sights, tactical flashlights and laser aiming modules. These variants are used by Israeli special forces. \n\nThe Uzi and its variants are simply the most popular SMGs in the world, being manufactured in great numbers (probably, more that 10 millions manufactured around the world until today)."
